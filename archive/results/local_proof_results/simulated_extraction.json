  "text": "\nCorporate Governance Legal Requirements\n\nOverview\nCorporate governance involves the mechanisms, relations, and processes by which corporations are directed and controlled. The governance structure specifies the distribution of rights and responsibilities among the different participants in the corporation and spells out the rules and procedures for decision-making on corporate affairs.\n\nBoard of Directors Obligations\nThe board of directors shall exercise oversight of the corporation's operations and strategic direction. Directors must act in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. Each director has a fiduciary duty to exercise reasonable care in decision-making processes.\n\nThe board shall establish an audit committee comprised of independent directors. The audit committee must review and approve all material transactions between the corporation and related parties. Directors are prohibited from engaging in transactions that create conflicts of interest without proper disclosure and approval.\n\nExecutive Compensation Requirements  \nThe compensation committee shall determine executive compensation based on performance metrics aligned with shareholder value creation. Executive compensation packages must be disclosed in annual proxy statements. The corporation must maintain clawback provisions that allow recovery of compensation based on financial restatements.\n\nShareholder Rights\nShareholders have the right to vote on fundamental corporate matters including mergers, acquisitions, and major asset sales. Shareholders may inspect corporate books and records upon proper demand. The corporation shall provide shareholders with annual reports and quarterly financial statements.\n\nShareholders are entitled to elect directors through majority vote or cumulative voting procedures as specified in corporate bylaws. Any shareholder holding more than 5% of outstanding shares must disclose their ownership position.\n\nRegulatory Compliance Obligations\nThe corporation must comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations. Financial statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The corporation shall maintain internal controls over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nManagement must certify the accuracy of financial statements and internal controls annually. The corporation is required to establish a whistleblower program that protects employees who report violations of law or corporate policy.\n\nDisclosure Requirements\nThe corporation must promptly disclose all material information that could affect the stock price. Insider trading is strictly prohibited, and the corporation must maintain policies preventing such activities. All material agreements and transactions must be disclosed in regulatory filings.\n\nThe corporation shall provide equal access to information for all shareholders and shall not engage in selective disclosure practices. Quarterly earnings calls and annual shareholder meetings must be open to all investors.\n\nEnforcement and Penalties\nViolation of corporate governance requirements may result in regulatory sanctions, including fines, cease and desist orders, and individual liability for directors and officers. The Securities and Exchange Commission has authority to investigate and prosecute violations of federal securities laws.\n\nShareholders may bring derivative lawsuits against directors and officers for breaches of fiduciary duty. Class action lawsuits may be filed for securities fraud or other violations of shareholder rights.\n",
