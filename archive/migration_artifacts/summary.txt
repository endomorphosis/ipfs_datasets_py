# Summary of Fixes for RAG Query Optimizer

We've successfully addressed the remaining issues in the RAG Query Optimizer:

## 1. Query Statistics Counting with Cache Hits

**Issue**: Query count was being incremented for cache hits, leading to inconsistent statistics.

**Fix**:
1. Updated the cache hit rate calculation to use `hits / (hits + misses)` instead of `hits / query_count`
2. Modified the cache hit handling in `execute_query_with_caching` to:
   - Call `record_cache_hit()` to track the cache hit
   - NOT call `record_query_time()` which would incorrectly increment `query_count`
   - Update other statistics directly without incrementing the query count

## 2. Caching Functionality Improvements

**Issue**: Cache keys were not sufficiently unique, and error handling was limited.

**Fixes**:
1. Improved cache key generation with more comprehensive vector representation
2. Added more robust error handling in cache operations
3. Enhanced backup and error recovery in caching code
4. Better diagnostics for cache misses

These changes ensure that:
- Query statistics are correctly tracked for both cache hits and misses
- Cache hit rates are accurately calculated
- Cache keys are more robust, leading to fewer cache misses
- Error handling provides better diagnostics
