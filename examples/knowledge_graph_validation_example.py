    IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data
    in a distributed file system. IPFS was created by Juan Benet and is now developed by Protocol Labs.
    The development of IPFS began in 2014 and was first released in February 2015. Protocol Labs was
    also founded by Juan Benet in 2014. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file
    in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. Filecoin is a cryptocurrency built on top
    of IPFS, developed by Protocol Labs. IPFS is written in Go and JavaScript.
