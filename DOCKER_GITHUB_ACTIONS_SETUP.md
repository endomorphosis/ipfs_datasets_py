# Docker and GitHub Actions Setup - Complete Guide

## 🎉 Summary

This repository now has complete Docker support with GitHub Actions CI/CD for multi-platform builds and testing.

## ✅ What Has Been Completed

### 1. Docker Images

#### Fixed Docker Support
- ✅ **Fixed `setup.py`**: Removed invalid local file URLs that were causing build failures
- ✅ **Created `Dockerfile.minimal-test`**: Minimal working Docker image for testing
- ✅ **Tested on x86_64**: Successfully built and tested on x86_64 architecture

#### Available Dockerfiles
- `Dockerfile` - Full production image with IPFS
- `Dockerfile.test` - Test image (needs setup.py fix to work)
- `Dockerfile.minimal-test` - **Working minimal test image** (recommended)
- `Dockerfile.mcp-minimal` - MCP server minimal image
- `Dockerfile.dashboard-minimal` - Dashboard minimal image
- `Dockerfile.mcp-simple` - Simple MCP server

### 2. Docker Compose

#### Configuration Files
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Full stack with PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, IPFS
- ✅ `docker-compose.mcp.yml` - MCP server and dashboard setup
- ✅ `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- ✅ `.env` - Created from example

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### New Workflows Created
- ✅ `.github/workflows/docker-build-test.yml` - **Main multi-platform build and test workflow**
  - Tests on GitHub-hosted x86_64 runners
  - Tests on self-hosted x86_64 runners (if available)
  - Tests on self-hosted ARM64 runners (if available)
  - Builds multi-architecture images (amd64 + arm64)
  - Publishes to GitHub Container Registry

#### Existing Workflows
- `.github/workflows/docker-ci.yml` - Original Docker CI
- `.github/workflows/self-hosted-runner.yml` - Runner verification

### 4. Documentation

- ✅ `docs/RUNNER_SETUP.md` - **Complete guide for setting up self-hosted runners**
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Security considerations
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Resource requirements

### 5. Test Scripts

- ✅ `test_docker_x86.sh` - Automated Docker testing script for x86_64
  - Builds minimal test image
  - Runs container tests
  - Validates package imports
  - Checks environment variables

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test Locally (x86_64)

```bash
# 1. Run the automated test script
bash test_docker_x86.sh

# 2. Or build manually
docker build -t ipfs-datasets-py:test -f Dockerfile.minimal-test .

# 3. Run the container
docker run --rm ipfs-datasets-py:test

# 4. Test with compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d
```

### Set Up Self-Hosted Runners

See **[docs/RUNNER_SETUP.md](./docs/RUNNER_SETUP.md)** for complete instructions.

Quick steps:
1. Go to Settings → Actions → Runners
2. Click "New self-hosted runner"
3. Follow the setup instructions
4. Add labels: `self-hosted`, `linux`, `x86_64` (or `arm64`)

## 📊 Test Results

### Current Platform: x86_64 ✅

```
Architecture: x86_64
OS: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
Docker: 28.5.1

✅ Image built successfully (561MB)
✅ Container runs correctly
✅ Package imports work (with some optional dependencies missing)
✅ Environment variables work
```

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. setup.py File URL Issues
**Problem**: Build was failing with "Invalid URL given" error

**Solution**: Commented out local file URLs in `extras_require`:
```python
# Before (broken)
'legal': [
    'scrape_the_law_mk3 @ file:./ipfs_datasets_py/mcp_server/tools/legal_dataset_tools/scrape_the_law_mk3',
],

# After (fixed)
'legal': [
    # 'scrape_the_law_mk3 @ file:./ipfs_datasets_py/mcp_server/tools/legal_dataset_tools/scrape_the_law_mk3',
],
```

### 2. ipfshttpclient Version
**Problem**: `ipfshttpclient>=0.8.0` not available on PyPI

**Solution**: Use alpha version:
```dockerfile
"ipfshttpclient>=0.8.0a2" \
```

### 3. Missing Dependencies
**Note**: Some optional dependencies from your custom packages are not on PyPI:
- `orbitdb_kit_py`
- `ipfs_kit_py`
- `ipfs_model_manager_py`
- `ipfs_faiss_py`

These are installed locally but won't be available in Docker builds. The package still works with warnings about missing optional features.

## 🎯 GitHub Actions Integration

### Workflow Triggers

The workflows trigger on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Changes to Docker files, workflows, or source code

### Test Matrix

| Platform | Runner Type | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| linux/amd64 | GitHub-hosted | ✅ Always runs |
| linux/amd64 | Self-hosted | ⏭️ Runs if runner available |
| linux/arm64 | Self-hosted | ⏭️ Runs if runner available |
| Multi-arch | Buildx + QEMU | ✅ On main branch |

### Registry Publishing

Images are pushed to GitHub Container Registry:
```
ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs_datasets_py:latest
ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs_datasets_py:main
ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs_datasets_py:sha-<commit>
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ **Test locally** - Run `bash test_docker_x86.sh`
2. ✅ **Commit and push** - Push to GitHub to trigger CI/CD
3. ⏭️ **Monitor workflows** - Check Actions tab for build status

### Optional (Enhanced Testing)
1. ⏭️ **Set up self-hosted x86_64 runner** - See docs/RUNNER_SETUP.md
2. ⏭️ **Set up self-hosted ARM64 runner** - For Raspberry Pi or ARM servers
3. ⏭️ **Configure secrets** - Add API keys for full functionality:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`

### Future Improvements
1. ⏭️ **Optimize image size** - Current: 561MB, Target: <300MB
2. ⏭️ **Add integration tests** - Test MCP server and dashboard
3. ⏭️ **Set up continuous deployment** - Auto-deploy on successful builds
4. ⏭️ **Add security scanning** - Already configured with Trivy

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- ✅ Docker images scanned with Trivy
- ✅ Secrets managed via GitHub Secrets
- ✅ Self-hosted runners should be on isolated machines
- ✅ Container runs as non-root (in production image)

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "Invalid URL"
- **Cause**: setup.py has local file URLs
- **Fix**: Already fixed in this PR

### "ipfshttpclient>=0.8.0" not found
- **Cause**: Version not on PyPI
- **Fix**: Use `0.8.0a2` (already updated in Dockerfile.minimal-test)

### Self-hosted runner not running jobs
- **Check**: Runner is online in Settings → Actions → Runners
- **Check**: Runner has correct labels (`self-hosted`, `linux`, `x86_64` or `arm64`)
- **Check**: Workflow file uses correct label syntax

### Docker permission denied
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
