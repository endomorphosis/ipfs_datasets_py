Complete End-to-End Legal Document to Theorem Prover Pipeline

This script demonstrates the complete capability:
1. Install SAT/SMT solvers and theorem provers 
2. Extract long statements from website text
3. Process through GraphRAG to deontic logic
4. Execute actual proofs using installed theorem provers
5. Works end-to-end with comprehensive error handling

This addresses the requirements in comment #3240444719.

Comprehensive Legal Requirements and Obligations Analysis

Corporate Governance and Fiduciary Duties

The board of directors of any publicly traded corporation shall exercise diligent oversight of the corporation's operations, strategic planning, and risk management processes, ensuring that all decisions are made in the best interests of shareholders while maintaining compliance with applicable federal securities laws, state corporate law, and regulatory requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other relevant regulatory bodies.

Each individual director has a personal fiduciary duty to exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence in the performance of their duties, which includes staying informed about the corporation's business, attending board meetings regularly, asking appropriate questions, and making decisions based on adequate information and consideration of all relevant factors that could affect shareholder value and corporate performance.

The audit committee, which must be comprised entirely of independent directors as defined by applicable stock exchange listing standards and SEC regulations, shall review and approve all material transactions between the corporation and related parties, ensure the integrity of financial reporting processes, oversee the external audit function, and maintain direct communication with the independent auditors regarding any concerns about financial controls or reporting accuracy.

Employment and Labor Law Obligations

Every employer shall provide a workplace that is free from recognized hazards and shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including but not limited to maintaining proper safety equipment, conducting regular safety training for all employees, implementing hazard communication programs, and reporting workplace injuries and illnesses as required by federal and state regulations.

Employers are prohibited from discriminating against employees or job applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information, and must provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities unless such accommodations would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business as determined by factors including the nature and cost of the accommodation and the overall financial resources of the employer.

All employees have the right to organize, form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and employers are prohibited from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of these rights as guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act.

Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Requirements

Any person or entity that creates, develops, or improves intellectual property while employed by or under contract with an organization shall disclose such intellectual property to the organization in accordance with the terms of their employment agreement or contract, and the organization shall have the right to determine whether to pursue patent protection, copyright registration, or trade secret protection for such intellectual property based on its potential commercial value and strategic importance.

Licensees of patented technology must comply with all terms and conditions of their license agreements, including payment of required royalties, adherence to field-of-use restrictions, compliance with quality control standards, and providing accurate reports of sales or usage as specified in the licensing agreement, and any breach of these obligations may result in termination of the license and liability for damages including lost profits and reasonable attorney fees.

Universities and research institutions that receive federal funding for research activities must comply with technology transfer requirements including disclosure of inventions to funding agencies, allowing government rights in inventions as specified by applicable federal regulations, and ensuring that any exclusive licenses granted to private entities include provisions for reasonable pricing of products developed using federally funded research.

Contract Law and Performance Obligations

In any contract for the sale of goods governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, the seller has an obligation to deliver goods that conform to the contract specifications in terms of quantity, quality, and packaging, and must provide timely delivery as specified in the contract terms, while the buyer has corresponding obligations to accept conforming goods, make payment according to the agreed terms, and provide reasonable cooperation in the delivery process.

Service providers under professional services agreements must perform their services with the degree of skill, care, and diligence normally exercised by qualified professionals in the same field under similar circumstances, must maintain confidentiality of client information and proprietary data, must avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise their professional judgment, and must deliver all work products and documentation as specified in the statement of work within the agreed timeframes.

Any party to a contract who materially breaches their obligations under the agreement may be liable for direct damages, incidental damages, and consequential damages that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract formation, provided that the non-breaching party has made reasonable efforts to mitigate their damages and has provided appropriate notice of the breach as required by the contract terms or applicable law.

Data Privacy and Security Obligations

Organizations that collect, process, or store personal information must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect such information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, including but not limited to encryption of sensitive data, access controls limiting data access to authorized personnel only, regular security assessments and penetration testing, and incident response procedures for addressing data breaches.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation and similar privacy laws, data controllers must obtain valid consent from individuals before processing their personal data, must provide clear and comprehensive privacy notices explaining how personal data will be used, must allow individuals to exercise their rights including access, rectification, erasure, and data portability, and must report data breaches to supervisory authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

Healthcare organizations subject to HIPAA must implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, must train all workforce members on privacy and security requirements, must conduct regular risk assessments and security evaluations, and must enter into business associate agreements with any third parties that may have access to protected health information in the course of providing services to the covered entity.

International Trade and Export Control Compliance

Any person or entity engaged in the export or re-export of goods, technology, or software must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and must obtain all required licenses and authorizations before engaging in any restricted transactions.

Importers of goods into the United States must ensure accurate classification of their merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, must pay all applicable duties and fees as determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, must comply with all applicable health, safety, and environmental regulations for imported products, and must maintain detailed records of all import transactions for the period specified by law.

Companies engaged in international business transactions must comply with anti-corruption laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign officials to obtain or retain business, requires accurate books and records, and mandates the implementation of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in accordance with management's general or specific authorization.
