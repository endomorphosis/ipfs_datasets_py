# Enhanced Caselaw Dashboard - Professional Legal Research Platform

## Overview

The Caselaw Access Project GraphRAG dashboard has been comprehensively enhanced with three new professional panels for individual case viewing, transforming it from a basic legal research tool into a sophisticated platform suitable for professional legal practice.

## üéØ New Features Implemented

### 1. ‚öñÔ∏è Deontic First-Order Logic Panel

**Purpose**: Provides formal logical analysis of legal text to extract precise legal statements and their relationships.

**Key Features**:
- **Deontic Statement Extraction**: Automatically identifies obligations (O), permissions (P), and prohibitions (F) from legal text
- **Formal Logic Conversion**: Converts legal language into first-order temporal deontic logic expressions
- **Central Holdings Analysis**: Extracts and analyzes the core legal holdings of each case
- **Precedential Strength Assessment**: Evaluates the binding authority based on court hierarchy
- **Legal Modality Distribution**: Shows the distribution of different types of legal statements
- **Temporal Constraints**: Identifies time-based conditions and requirements

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/case/<case_id>/deontic-logic`

**Sample Analysis Output**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "case_id": "brown_v_board_1954",
  "deontic_analysis": {
    "deontic_statements": [
      {
        "type": "obligation",
        "content": "provide equal educational opportunities",
        "confidence": 0.9
      }
    ],
    "formal_logic_expressions": [
      {
        "formal_statement": "O(provide equal educational opportunities)",
        "natural_language": "It is obligatory that schools provide equal educational opportunities"
      }
    ],
    "central_holdings": [
      {
        "holding_text": "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal",
        "type": "primary_holding",
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    ],
    "precedential_strength": {
      "strength_level": "highest",
      "strength_score": 1.0,
      "binding_scope": "nationwide"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. üîó Citation Network & Connections Panel

**Purpose**: Visualizes the complete citation ecosystem around a case, showing its relationship to other cases through citations.

**Key Features**:
- **Backward Citations**: Cases cited by the current case (precedents it relies on)

- Statistical dashboard showing citation counts and network metrics
- Clickable case nodes for navigation
- Court hierarchy visualization

### 3. üí¨ Subsequent Quotes & Central Holdings Panel

**Purpose**: Analyzes how subsequent cases quote and reference the central holdings of the current case, providing insight into its ongoing influence.

**Key Features**:
- **Quote Extraction**: Identifies quotes from subsequent cases that reference this case
- **Legal Principle Grouping**: Organizes quotes by the specific legal principles they address
- **Central Holdings Identification**: Highlights the most important legal holdings from the case
- **Quote Type Classification**: Categorizes quotes as holdings, rationale, or dicta

- **Citation Trend Analysis**: Tracks how the case is cited over time
- **Most Quoted Holdings**: Identifies which holdings are most frequently referenced

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/case/<case_id>/subsequent-quotes`

**Sample Features**:
- Collapsible quote groups organized by legal principle
- Quote type badges (holding, rationale, dicta) with color coding
- Relevance scoring system
- Temporal analysis of citation patterns
- Direct links to citing cases
