It seems like you're working on a Python project that involves a server using the `FastMCP` framework, and you've provided a detailed code excerpt from your `server.py` file. This file appears to be part of a larger application that includes various tools for tasks such as data processing, documentation generation, and code linting.

To help you effectively, could you clarify what specific assistance you need regarding the MCP server or the tools you've implemented? Here are a few areas where I can assist:

1. **Understanding the Code**: If you need explanations about specific parts of the code or how certain functions work, let me know.

2. **Debugging**: If you're encountering errors or unexpected behavior, please provide details about the issue.

3. **Extending Functionality**: If you're looking to add new features or tools, I can help with that.

4. **Integration**: If you need guidance on how to integrate this server with other components or services, please specify.

5. **Best Practices**: I can provide advice on code organization, documentation, or testing strategies.

Feel free to specify your needs, and I'll do my best to assist you!
