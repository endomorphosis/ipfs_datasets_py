### Calling the MCP Server

1. **Run the Server**: You can run the server by executing the `server.py` script. This will start the MCP server and register all the tools defined in the script.

   ```bash
   python /home/barberb/ipfs_datasets_py/claudes_toolbox/server.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Server**: Once the server is running, you can interact with it using the registered tools. You can send requests to the server using the appropriate transport method (e.g., `stdio`, HTTP, etc.).

### Importing the Package

If you want to import the package in another Python script, you can do so by following these steps:

1. **Ensure the Package is in Your Python Path**: Make sure that the directory containing the `server.py` file is included in your Python path. You can do this by adding the directory to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or by modifying `sys.path` in your script.

   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.append('/home/barberb/ipfs_datasets_py/claudes_toolbox')
   ```

2. **Import the Necessary Classes/Functions**: You can import the `FastMCP` server and any tools you need directly from the package.

   ```python
   from modelcontextprotocol.server import FastMCP
   from your_tool_module import your_tool_function  # Replace with actual tool imports
   ```

3. **Initialize and Use the Server**: You can create an instance of the `FastMCP` server and register tools as needed.

   ```python
   mcp = FastMCP("your_toolbox_name")
   mcp.add_tool(your_tool_function, name="your_tool_name", description="Your tool description")
   ```

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how you might set up and use the server in another script:

```python
from modelcontextprotocol.server import FastMCP
from your_tool_module import your_tool_function  # Replace with actual tool imports

# Initialize the MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("my_toolbox")

# Register a tool
mcp.add_tool(your_tool_function, name="my_tool", description="This is my tool.")

# Run the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```

### Conclusion

You can either run the server as a standalone application or import it into another script to use its functionalities. Make sure to replace placeholders with actual tool names and paths as needed.
