# Auto-Healing System - Security Considerations

## Overview

The enhanced auto-healing system creates branches, issues, and pull requests automatically. This document outlines security considerations and best practices to ensure the system operates safely.

## Security Model

### Principle: Least Privilege
The workflows operate with minimal required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write        # For creating branches and commits
  pull-requests: write   # For creating PRs and comments
  issues: write          # For creating and updating issues
  actions: read          # For reading workflow run data
```

### Token Security

**GITHUB_TOKEN**:
- Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- Scoped to the repository only (cannot access other repos or org-level resources)
- Expires at the end of the workflow run
- Cannot access organization secrets or resources
- Limited to the permissions explicitly declared
- Does not have access to Personal Access Tokens or SSH keys

**Best Practices**:
✅ Never log or expose GITHUB_TOKEN
✅ Use `env.GH_TOKEN` instead of direct token in commands
✅ Token automatically redacted in logs by GitHub

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats

1. **Malicious Code Injection**
   - **Risk**: Auto-generated code could introduce vulnerabilities
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - All PRs created as DRAFT status
     - Requires manual review before merge
     - Automated tests run before merge
     - CodeQL scanning on all PRs

2. **Privilege Escalation**
   - **Risk**: Workflow could be manipulated to gain more permissions
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Permissions explicitly limited
     - No use of PATs (Personal Access Tokens)
     - Runs in isolated containers
     - No access to repository secrets

3. **Denial of Service**
   - **Risk**: Excessive workflow runs or PR creation
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Duplicate detection prevents re-processing
     - Rate limiting via workflow concurrency
     - Manual approval required for merges

4. **Supply Chain Attack**
   - **Risk**: Malicious dependencies in auto-generated fixes
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Dependency analysis before installation
     - Pinned action versions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4)
     - Review of all dependency additions

5. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Risk**: Sensitive data in logs or artifacts
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Log sanitization
     - Artifact retention limited to 30 days
     - No secrets in workflow outputs

## Security Controls

### 1. Input Validation

**Workflow Inputs**:
```yaml
# Example: domain input validation
domain:
  type: choice
  options:
    - all
    - caselaw
    - finance
    - medicine
    - software
```

- ✅ Use enum/choice types for inputs
- ✅ Validate file paths before operations
- ✅ Sanitize user-provided strings
- ✅ Reject unexpected input formats

### 2. Branch Protection

**Recommended Settings**:
```yaml
# In repository settings
Branch Protection Rules:
  - Require pull request reviews (at least 1)
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require conversation resolution
  - Require signed commits (optional)
  - Include administrators (recommended)
```

### 3. Workflow Isolation

**Container Isolation**:
```yaml
container:
  image: python:3.12-slim
  options: --user root  # Required for apt-get operations in container setup
```

**Note on Root Access**: The workflows run with root in containers for:
- Installing system dependencies (apt-get) during setup
- Ensuring git operations work correctly in containerized environment
- Mitigated by: Container isolation, ephemeral nature (destroyed after run), no persistent storage

**Alternative**: Consider using pre-built images with dependencies to avoid root requirement.

- ✅ Runs in isolated Docker containers
- ✅ No network access to internal systems
- ✅ Limited to self-hosted runner resources
- ✅ Clean environment per run

### 4. Audit Trail

**Logging & Tracking**:
- All workflow runs logged in GitHub Actions
- All commits signed with bot identity
- All PRs and issues tagged with labels
- Artifacts retained for forensic analysis

## Safe Operation Guidelines

### For Auto-Generated Code

1. **Never Auto-Merge**
   - All PRs require manual review
   - Draft status prevents accidental merge
   - Tests must pass before review

2. **Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Code changes match described fix
   - [ ] No unexpected file modifications
   - [ ] No new dependencies without justification
   - [ ] Tests pass successfully
   - [ ] No security warnings from CodeQL
   - [ ] Changes follow coding standards

3. **High-Risk Changes**
   Changes requiring extra scrutiny:
   - Workflow file modifications
   - Dependency updates
   - Permission changes
   - Network operations
   - File system operations

### For Workflow Modifications

1. **Testing Protocol**
   - Test in fork or separate branch first
   - Use workflow_dispatch for manual testing
   - Verify permissions are minimal
   - Check for unintended side effects

2. **Code Review Requirements**
   - All workflow changes need review
   - Security team review for permission changes
   - Test results must be verified

## Incident Response

### Detecting Issues

**Warning Signs**:
- ⚠️ Unexpected PRs created
- ⚠️ Excessive workflow runs
- ⚠️ Failed security scans
- ⚠️ Unusual branch creation patterns
- ⚠️ Workflow permission errors

### Response Procedure

1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Disable auto-healing workflows (adjust filenames as needed)
   gh workflow disable copilot-agent-autofix.yml
   gh workflow disable comprehensive-scraper-validation.yml
   
   # Close suspicious PRs
   gh pr close PR_NUMBER
   
   # Delete suspicious branches
   git push origin --delete BRANCH_NAME
   ```

2. **Investigation**
   - Review workflow run logs
   - Check artifact contents
   - Analyze created PRs and commits
   - Identify root cause

3. **Remediation**
   - Fix vulnerability in workflow
   - Update security controls
   - Document incident
   - Update runbooks

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Handling

**Sensitive Data**:
- ❌ Never store credentials in workflows
- ❌ Never log sensitive information
- ❌ Never commit secrets to repository
- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for credentials
- ✅ Sanitize logs before storing
- ✅ Limit artifact retention

**GDPR/Privacy**:
- Logs may contain email addresses (bot@users.noreply.github.com)
- No PII collected or stored
- Artifacts auto-deleted after 30 days

### Access Control

**Repository Access**:
- Admin: Full access to all features
- Write: Can trigger workflows, review PRs
- Read: Can view workflows and artifacts
- No public access to workflow artifacts

## Hardening Recommendations

### Level 1: Basic (Required)

- [x] Use minimal permissions
- [x] Draft PRs only
- [x] Manual review required
- [x] Automated testing
- [x] Duplicate detection

### Level 2: Enhanced (Recommended)

- [ ] Enable CodeQL scanning
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Require signed commits
- [ ] Enable branch protection
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Level 3: Advanced (Optional)

- [ ] Custom security scanning
- [ ] Workflow signing
- [ ] External security reviews
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security metrics dashboard

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Metrics to Track

1. **Security Metrics**
   - Failed permission checks
   - Unexpected workflow triggers
   - Invalid input attempts
   - Security scan failures

2. **Operational Metrics**
   - PR creation rate
   - Merge success rate
   - Time to merge
   - Fix confidence scores

### Alerting Configuration

**Critical Alert Conditions** (implement in your monitoring system):

- Workflow permission denied or elevated
- More than 10 PRs created in 1 hour
- Security scan failure on auto-generated code
- Unexpected workflow modification
- Repeated workflow failures (>5 in 24 hours)

**Example Monitoring Integration**:
```python
# Pseudocode for monitoring integration
if pr_creation_rate > threshold:
    alert_team("Unusual auto-healing activity detected")
```
