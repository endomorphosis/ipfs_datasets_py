## 🔄 Workflow Changes Summary

### Before Enhancement
```
Failure Detected → Issue Created → Wait for Manual Fix
```

**Problems**:
- No automated PR creation
- No Copilot integration
- Manual intervention always required

```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic draft PR creation
- ✅ Copilot triggered via @mention
- ✅ Structured fix workflow
- ✅ Clear progress tracking
- ✅ Reduced time to resolution
