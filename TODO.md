## Handoff Notes for Future Workers
- **Current Status**: Worker assignments expanded to include specialized roles
- **Completed**: Workers 67 (search/), 130 (tests/) have finished their assignments
- **Active Directory Workers**: 61-66, 68-75 ready to begin TDD implementation
- **Tool Workers**: Worker 160 (Enhancement) and Worker 175 (QA) assigned
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Directory workers can begin TDD implementation in their assigned directories
  - Tool workers can enhance and validate adhoc tools infrastructure
  - Integration testing coordination needed between completed and pending workers
- **Tool Usage**: Use `python adhoc_tools/find_documentation.py` to monitor documentation file status
- **Integration**: Workers should coordinate through project-level TODO.md for cross-directory dependencies

## Edge Case Test Requirements

### PDF Processing - GraphRAG Integrator
**Priority**: High - Based on recent debugging session 2025-07-13

- [ ] **Make test stubs for** `get_entity_neighborhood` method edge cases:
  - [ ] **Depth validation edge cases**:
    - Make test stubs for depth=0 validation (should return only center entity)
    - Make test stubs for negative depth validation (should raise ValueError)
    - Make test stubs for non-integer depth validation (should raise TypeError)
    - Make test stubs for extremely large depth values (performance boundaries)
  
  - [ ] **Entity ID validation edge cases**:
    - Make test stubs for None entity_id parameter (should raise TypeError with specific message)
    - Make test stubs for empty string entity_id parameter (should raise ValueError)
    - Make test stubs for non-string entity_id types (int, list, dict validation)
    - Make test stubs for entity_id with special characters and Unicode
  
  - [ ] **Graph structure edge cases**:
    - Make test stubs for isolated entities (no connections)
    - Make test stubs for self-referencing edges (entity -> entity loops)
    - Make test stubs for cyclic graphs (prevent infinite traversal)
    - Make test stubs for disconnected graph components
    - Make test stubs for empty global graph scenarios
  
  - [ ] **Subgraph completeness edge cases**:
    - Make test stubs for edge count accuracy within subgraph neighborhoods
    - Make test stubs for indirect edge inclusion (edges between neighbors)
    - Make test stubs for breadth-first traversal correctness
    - Make test stubs for predecessor and successor edge handling
  
  - [ ] **Performance and scalability edge cases**:
    - Make test stubs for large neighborhood processing (>1000 nodes)
    - Make test stubs for concurrent access scenarios
    - Make test stubs for memory usage patterns with deep neighborhoods
    - Make test stubs for JSON serialization compatibility of results
  
  - [ ] **Error handling edge cases**:
    - Make test stubs for nonexistent entity lookup scenarios
    - Make test stubs for corrupted graph data structures
    - Make test stubs for missing entity attributes in nodes
    - Make test stubs for malformed edge data validation

**Context**: These edge cases were identified during debugging session where 5 test failures revealed:
1. Incorrect depth validation (was rejecting depth=0)
2. Wrong edge count expectations (test expected only direct edges, implementation correctly includes all subgraph edges)
3. Regex pattern mismatch in error message validation
4. Need for comprehensive boundary condition testing

**Assignment Suggestion**: Assign to Worker focused on pdf_processing/ directory testing
