# Audit Logging and Reporting System

This document describes the audit logging and reporting system implementation in the IPFS Datasets Python project.

## Components

### Core Components

- **`audit_logger.py`**: Core audit logging functionality with the `AuditLogger` singleton
- **`audit_visualization.py`**: Metrics collection and visualization tools
- **`audit_reporting.py`**: Comprehensive reporting and analysis capabilities
- **`handlers.py`**: Various handlers for audit events (file, database, alerting)
- **`enhanced_security.py`**: Advanced security features for audit logging
- **`intrusion.py`**: Intrusion detection based on audit events

## Audit Reporting Features

The audit reporting system provides comprehensive analysis of audit data with the following features:

### Pattern Detection
- Authentication anomalies (brute force attempts, unusual login patterns)
- Access control anomalies (unusual resource access, unexpected modifications)
- System health indicators (error rates, critical events)
- Compliance violations and security breaches

### Risk Assessment
- Category-based risk scoring (authentication, access control, system integrity, compliance)
- Anomaly detection with severity rating
- Comprehensive risk trends and early warning indicators
- Weighted overall risk score calculation
