# Logic Port Daemon

`ipfs_datasets_py.optimizers.logic_port_daemon` is development tooling for iteratively improving the browser-native TypeScript/WASM port of the Python logic module.

It reads the TypeScript port roadmap as its controlling plan:

- `docs/IPFS_DATASETS_LOGIC_TYPESCRIPT_PORT_PLAN.md`
- `docs/LOGIC_PORT_PARITY.md`

The nested deterministic parser plans are intentionally not the default task source for this daemon. Parser-specific work should be handled by the parser daemon.

Historical context:

- `docs/logic/DETERMINISTIC_LEGAL_PARSER_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`
- `docs/logic/DETERMINISTIC_LEGAL_PARSER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

It then calls `ipfs_datasets_py.llm_router.generate_text()` with `model_name="gpt-5.5"` and asks for a conservative TypeScript port improvement. GPT-family models are pinned to the router's `codex_cli` provider unless `--provider` is supplied, so the request flows through `codex exec` rather than local Hugging Face fallback. The daemon disables local Hugging Face fallback by default, because autonomous code changes should fail closed if the configured router cannot reach the requested model. The daemon only applies model output through allowlisted file replacements or `git apply`; it does not execute arbitrary commands returned by the model.

## Dry Run

```bash
PYTHONPATH=ipfs_datasets_py python -m ipfs_datasets_py.optimizers.logic_port_daemon \
  --repo-root . \
  --iterations 1
```

Dry run is the default. It calls the router, parses the proposed patch, and reports the session result without mutating files.

## Apply Patches

```bash
PYTHONPATH=ipfs_datasets_py python -m ipfs_datasets_py.optimizers.logic_port_daemon \
  --repo-root . \
  --iterations 3 \
  --apply
```

With `--apply`, each patch must pass `git apply --check` before it is applied. After application, the daemon runs:

- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run validate:logic-port`

Use `--validation-command` to override those checks, or `--skip-validation` for a fast local experiment.

## Supervised Continuous Mode

```bash
PYTHONPATH=ipfs_datasets_py python3 -m ipfs_datasets_py.optimizers.logic_port_daemon \
  --repo-root . \
  --apply \
  --watch \
  --retry-interval 300 \
  --log-file ipfs_datasets_py/.daemon/logic-port-daemon.jsonl
```

Continuous mode runs without user input. If the configured `gpt-5.5` route is unavailable, it records a structured failure, sleeps, and retries. When the route becomes available, it resumes patch generation, applies only patches that pass `git apply --check`, and then runs validation.

If a proposed patch fails `git apply --check`, the daemon stores the failed patch under `ipfs_datasets_py/.daemon/failed-patches/` and performs one automatic `gpt-5.5` repair attempt with the exact Git error before giving up on that cycle.

The prompt intentionally asks for one narrow requirement per cycle, at most 180 changed diff lines, and usually one implementation file plus one focused test. It now prefers exact `files` replacements over unified diffs for TypeScript/doc edits. File replacements are path-allowlisted and rolled back automatically if validation fails, which keeps overnight runs biased toward changes that can be applied and validated unattended.

The daemon also encodes local test-harness conventions. Logic tests run under Jest with global `describe`/`it`/`expect`, so proposals importing `vitest` or `@jest/globals` are rejected before any files are written. This avoids failed autonomous cycles that create valid-looking tests for the wrong runner.

## Markdown Task Tracking

The TypeScript port plan is the daemon's task ledger. By default this daemon maintains a generated `Daemon Task Board` inside `docs/IPFS_DATASETS_LOGIC_TYPESCRIPT_PORT_PLAN.md`. The nested deterministic parser implementation plan is intentionally left for the parser-specific daemon.

On each daemon round it:

- parses Markdown task checkboxes from the porting plan;
- treats `[x]` as complete, `[ ]` as needed, `[~]` as in progress, and `[!]` as blocked;
- selects the first task that is not complete and injects that task into the next LLM prompt;
- updates the task board after the round with the current target, checklist state, latest result, and follow-up instructions.

The task board is generated between marker comments, so manual plan prose can stay stable while the daemon rewrites only its own tracking section.

For accepted rounds, the daemon records the concrete changed files in the JSONL artifact and in the task board's latest-round section. Successful checkbox tasks are also marked complete in the source checklist so the next cycle advances to the next unfinished porting task instead of repeating invisible fixture work.

If the system Codex CLI is too old for `gpt-5.5`, install a local CLI and point the router at it:

```bash
npm install --prefix ipfs_datasets_py/.daemon/codex-cli @openai/codex@0.125.0

IPFS_DATASETS_PY_CODEX_CLI_BIN=ipfs_datasets_py/.daemon/codex-cli/node_modules/.bin/codex \
IPFS_DATASETS_PY_CODEX_SANDBOX=read-only \
PYTHONPATH=ipfs_datasets_py \
python3 -m ipfs_datasets_py.optimizers.logic_port_daemon \
  --repo-root . \
  --apply \
  --watch \
  --retry-interval 300 \
  --log-file ipfs_datasets_py/.daemon/logic-port-daemon.jsonl
```

## Runtime Boundary

This daemon is optimizer/development tooling. It must not be imported by the browser runtime and must not change the TypeScript logic port into a Python-service wrapper. The implementation target remains local TypeScript/WASM parity.
