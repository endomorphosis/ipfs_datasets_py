    GraphRAG Integrator for PDF Content Processing

    The GraphRAGIntegrator class provides comprehensive functionality for integrating PDF content
    into GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge structures. It processes
    LLM-optimized documents, extracts entities and relationships, creates knowledge graphs,
    and enables sophisticated querying capabilities across document collections.
    This class serves as the core component for building knowledge graphs from PDF documents,
    supporting both single-document analysis and cross-document relationship discovery.

    Args:
        storage (Optional[IPLDStorage], optional): IPLD storage instance for data persistence.
            Defaults to a new IPLDStorage instance if not provided.
        similarity_threshold (float, optional): Threshold for entity similarity matching.
            Values between 0.0 and 1.0, where higher values require more similarity.
            Defaults to 0.8.
        entity_extraction_confidence (float, optional): Minimum confidence score for 
            entity extraction. Values between 0.0 and 1.0, where higher values require
            more confidence. Defaults to 0.6.

    Key Features:
    - Entity extraction and relationship identification
    - Cross-document entity linking and relationship discovery
    - Persistent graph storage integration
    - Graph representations for advanced analysis
    - Natural language querying capabilities
    - Entity neighborhood exploration

    Attributes:
        storage (IPLDStorage): Storage instance for persistent graph storage
        similarity_threshold (float): Threshold for entity similarity matching (0.0-1.0)
        entity_extraction_confidence (float): Minimum confidence for entity extraction (0.0-1.0)
        knowledge_graphs (Dict[str, KnowledgeGraph]): Collection of document knowledge graphs
        global_entities (Dict[str, Entity]): Global entity registry across all documents
        cross_document_relationships (List[CrossDocumentRelationship]): Inter-document relationships
        document_graphs (Dict[str, nx.DiGraph]): Graph representations per document
        global_graph (nx.DiGraph): Global graph combining all documents

    Public Methods:
        integrate_document(llm_document: LLMDocument) -> KnowledgeGraph:
            Extracts entities, relationships, creates knowledge graph, stores persistently,
            and updates global graph structures.
        query_graph(query: str, graph_id: Optional[str] = None, max_results: int = 10) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            Query the knowledge graph using natural language queries.
            Supports both document-specific and global graph querying.
        get_entity_neighborhood(entity_id: str, depth: int = 2) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            Retrieve the neighborhood of a specific entity within the graph.
            Returns subgraph containing all nodes and edges within specified depth
            from the target entity.

    Usage Example:
    >>> integrator = GraphRAGIntegrator(
    ...     similarity_threshold=0.8,
    ...     entity_extraction_confidence=0.6
    ... )
    >>> # Process document
    >>> knowledge_graph = await integrator.integrate_document(llm_document)
    >>> # Query the graph
    >>> results = await integrator.query_graph("companies founded by John Smith")
    >>> # Explore entity relationships
    >>> neighborhood = await integrator.get_entity_neighborhood("entity_12345", depth=2)

# Example Method Stub

```python
def infer_relationship_type(self, entity1: Entity, entity2: Entity, context: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Infer the relationship type between two entities based on contextual information.

    This method analyzes the context string to determine the most appropriate relationship
    type between two entities. It supports the following relationship types:
    - Person-Organization
    - Organization-Organization
    - Person-Person
    - Location-based
    - Default

    Args:
        entity1 (Entity): The first entity in the relationship
        entity2 (Entity): The second entity in the relationship  
        context (str): The textual context containing information about the relationship

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The inferred relationship type, or None if no relationship can be determined.
                      Return values are:
                      - Person-Organization: 'leads', 'works_for', 'founded', 'associated_with'

                      - Person-Person: 'collaborates_with', 'manages', 'knows'
                      - Location-based: 'located_in'

    Raises:
        TypeError: If entity1 or entity2 is not an Entity instance
        ValueError: If context is empty or contains only whitespace
        AttributeError: If entities lack required type attribute

    Examples:
        >>> _infer_relationship_type(person_entity, org_entity, "John is the CEO of ACME Corp")
