# Archived Stub Files

This directory contains stub markdown files that were previously scattered throughout the processors directory. These files served as placeholders or documentation stubs but are no longer actively maintained.

## Archive Date

2026-02-15

## Contents

- 123 stub markdown files from various processor subdirectories
- Organized to preserve original directory structure

## Reason for Archival

These stub files were archived as part of the processors refactoring initiative (Phase 5: Stub Cleanup) to:
- Reduce clutter in active codebase
- Improve directory organization
- Make it easier to navigate processors directory
- Preserve historical documentation

## Location

Original locations are preserved in the subdirectory structure. For example:
- `multimedia/*.md` → from `processors/multimedia/`
- `legal_scrapers/*.md` → from `processors/legal_scrapers/`

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed, they can be restored from this archive or from git history.
