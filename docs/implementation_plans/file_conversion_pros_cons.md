## 🔀 What About Merging Them?

**Question:** Should these codebases be merged into one system?

**Short Answer:** ❌ **NO** - Keep them separate.

**Why Not:**
- Different architectural paradigms (OOP vs Functional)
- Different use cases (metadata vs speed)
- Would take 7-11 months and $162k-250k
- High risk of breaking working systems
- Both work well independently

**Details:** See [FILE_CONVERSION_MERGE_FEASIBILITY.md](FILE_CONVERSION_MERGE_FEASIBILITY.md) for complete analysis.

**Better Approach:**
- Use the right tool for each job
- Documentation helps users choose
- Both can evolve independently
- Lower risk, better outcomes
