# Auto-Generated Documentation Stubs

This directory contains auto-generated documentation stubs extracted from the source code. These files provide detailed function and class signatures with docstrings.

## Overview

The stub files in this directory are automatically generated from the Python source code and contain:

- Function signatures with parameter types
- Class definitions and method signatures  
- Complete docstring documentation
- Async/sync method indicators
- File timestamps and update information

## Organization

Stub files are organized by source module:
- `*_stubs.md` - Individual module stubs
- Generated from corresponding `.py` files in the main codebase
- Updated automatically when source code changes

## Usage

These files are primarily useful for:
- **Development reference** - Quick lookup of function signatures
- **IDE integration** - Type hints and documentation support
- **API documentation generation** - Source for automated docs
- **Code analysis** - Understanding class and function relationships

## Integration with Main Documentation

The information in these stub files should be integrated into the main documentation:

1. **README files** - Key functions and classes highlighted in module READMEs
2. **API reference** - Detailed parameter and return value documentation
3. **Examples** - Usage examples based on function signatures
4. **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides using documented methods

## Maintenance

- Stub files are regenerated automatically from source code
- No manual editing should be done to these files
- Use source code docstrings to improve stub content
- Integrate relevant information into main documentation files

## Note

This directory was created as part of documentation organization improvements to reduce clutter in main source directories while preserving the valuable auto-generated documentation content.
