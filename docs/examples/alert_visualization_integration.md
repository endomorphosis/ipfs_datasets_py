# Alert and Visualization System Integration

This document describes the integration between the RAG Query Optimizer's alert system and visualization system. The integration provides a comprehensive monitoring solution that can detect anomalies in the optimizer's learning process and visualize them alongside performance metrics.

## Components

### 1. `alert_visualization_integration.py`

This script demonstrates how to integrate the optimizer alert system with the visualization system. It includes:

- A simulated optimizer that generates learning metrics
- A metrics collector that adapts the optimizer's data for the alert system
- An alert system that detects anomalies in the learning process
- A visualization system that displays learning metrics
- A custom alert handler that connects the alert system to the visualization system
- A dashboard that combines metrics and alerts into a single view

### 2. Alert System

The alert system (`LearningAlertSystem`) detects various types of anomalies in the optimizer's learning process:

- **Parameter Oscillations**: When parameters change back and forth frequently
- **Performance Declines**: When success rates drop or latencies increase
- **Strategy Effectiveness Issues**: When certain strategies become less effective
- **Learning Stalls**: When no parameter adjustments occur despite query pattern changes

### 3. Visualization System

The visualization system (`LiveOptimizerVisualization`) provides visualizations of the optimizer's learning metrics:

- **Learning Cycles**: Visualizes how the optimizer learns over time
