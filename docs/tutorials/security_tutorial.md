## Introduction

Security and governance are critical for data processing workflows, especially when handling sensitive or regulated data. IPFS Datasets Python provides comprehensive features for securing your data, controlling access, tracking provenance, and maintaining audit logs.

## Prerequisites

- IPFS Datasets Python installed:
  ```bash
  pip install ipfs-datasets-py
  ```
- Basic understanding of security concepts and data governance
- (Optional) System keyring for secure key storage

## Security Configuration

First, let's configure the security system:

```python
# TODO: Complete this section with security configuration code when implementing the tutorial
```

## User Management

Next, let's set up user management with different roles:

```python

## Data Encryption

Let's set up encryption for sensitive data:

```python
# TODO: Complete this section with encryption code when implementing the tutorial
```

## Data Provenance Tracking

Now, let's implement data provenance tracking:

```python
