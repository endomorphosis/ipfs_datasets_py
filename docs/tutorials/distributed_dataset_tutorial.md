## Introduction

Distributed dataset management allows you to work with datasets that are too large for a single node, enables better fault tolerance through replication, and provides faster local access for geographically distributed teams.

## Prerequisites

- IPFS Datasets Python installed with libp2p dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install ipfs-datasets-py[distributed]
  ```
- Multiple IPFS nodes (can be on the same machine for testing)
- Basic understanding of distributed systems

## Setting Up Nodes

First, let's set up multiple nodes for our distributed network:

```python
# TODO: Complete this section with node setup code when implementing the tutorial
```

## Creating Sharded Datasets

Next, we'll create a dataset that's divided into manageable shards:

```python
# TODO: Complete this section with dataset sharding code when implementing the tutorial
```

## Distributing Data

Now, let's distribute the shards across our network:

```python
# TODO: Complete this section with data distribution code when implementing the tutorial
```

## Replicating Shards

To ensure fault tolerance, we'll set up replication of shards:

```python
# TODO: Complete this section with replication code when implementing the tutorial
```

## Federated Search

Let's implement federated search across the distributed dataset:

```python
# TODO: Complete this section with federated search code when implementing the tutorial
```

## Handling Node Failures

Now we'll address how to handle node failures:

```python

## Advanced Techniques

Here are some advanced techniques for distributed dataset management:
