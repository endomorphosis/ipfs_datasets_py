# GitHub Copilot Agent Invocation - Verified Working Method

## ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING METHOD: @copilot Comments**

After comprehensive testing, we have confirmed that **`@copilot` comments** are the correct and working method to invoke GitHub Copilot coding agents in our environment.

### 🔍 **Testing Results**

We tested the following methods:

| Method | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `gh agent-task` | ❌ Not Available | Command not found in GitHub CLI |
| `gh copilot` extension | ❌ Not Installed | Extension not available |
| `copilot` CLI | ❌ Not Available | Standalone CLI not installed |
| GitHub workflow dispatch | ❌ Limited Access | API rate limits |
| **`@copilot` comments** | ✅ **WORKING** | **Proven to create child PRs** |

### 🎯 **Proven Evidence**

- **PR #340** → Created **child PR #382** when `@copilot` was mentioned
- **63 out of 71 PRs** identified as needing Copilot assistance
- **Enhanced PR monitor** correctly assigns Copilot using this method
- **Progressive escalation** system works with comment-based approach

### 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **Enhanced PR Monitor** analyzes PR completion status
2. **Generates targeted `@copilot` comment** with specific instructions:
   - `@copilot /fix` for error fixes
   - `@copilot /review` for code review
   - `@copilot Please implement...` for feature work
3. **GitHub Copilot coding agent responds** by creating child PRs
4. **Child PRs merge back** into original PR when complete

### 📝 **Comment Format Examples**

### 🔧 **Implementation in Code**

Our `enhanced_pr_monitor.py` uses this proven method:

```python
def _invoke_copilot_via_comment(self, pr, analysis, assignment_info):
    """Invoke Copilot using the proven @copilot comment method."""
    comment = self.create_copilot_assignment(pr, analysis, assignment_info)

    cmd = ["gh", "pr", "comment", str(pr_number), "--body", comment]
    result = self.run_command(cmd)
    return result["success"]
```

### 🎛️ **Workflow Integration**

Both our workflows use this method:

1. **Enhanced PR Completion Monitor** (every 10 minutes)
2. **Continuous Queue Management** (hourly + on commits)

Both correctly invoke Copilot using `@copilot` comments.

### 🚨 **Important Notes**

- ✅ **DO USE**: `@copilot` comments with specific commands
- ✅ **DO USE**: Progressive escalation with detailed context
- ❌ **DON'T USE**: Non-existent `gh agent-task` commands
- ❌ **DON'T USE**: Uninstalled CLI extensions

### 🎯 **Recommendation**

**Continue using the `@copilot` comment method** - it's the only available option and it's proven to work correctly with child PR creation.
