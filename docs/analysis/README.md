- **complete_native_implementation.md** - Native implementation status
- **logic_tools_verification.md** - Logic tools validation
- **readme_diagnostics.md** - README file analysis

## Purpose

Analysis documents provide:
1. **Code Quality Insights** - Identify areas for improvement
2. **Technical Assessments** - Evaluate implementations
3. **Integration Status** - Track integration progress
4. **Decision Support** - Inform architectural decisions

## Organization

Analysis documents are organized by:
- **Type**: Code, feature, integration analysis
- **Scope**: Component-specific or system-wide
- **Status**: In-progress or completed assessments

## Using Analysis Docs

When working on the codebase:
1. Check for relevant analysis before major changes
2. Reference findings in technical discussions
3. Update analysis when implementations change
4. Add new analysis for significant features
