# Implementation Notes

Technical implementation details and design decisions for IPFS Datasets Python.

## Contents

This directory contains detailed technical documentation about specific implementations:

### Current Files
- [Audit System Implementation](audit_system_implementation.md) - Audit logging system
- [Index](index.md) - Implementation notes index

## Purpose

Implementation notes serve to:
1. **Document Design Decisions** - Why things are built a certain way
2. **Technical Deep Dives** - Detailed technical explanations
3. **Architecture Details** - Low-level architectural information
4. **Developer Reference** - Help developers understand the codebase

## Organization

Implementation notes are organized by:
- **Component**: Notes specific to a component (e.g., vector stores, embeddings)
- **Feature**: Notes about specific features (e.g., audit logging)
- **Integration**: Notes about integrations with external systems

## For Developers

When working on the codebase:
1. Check implementation notes for relevant components
2. Add notes for new complex implementations
3. Update notes when making significant changes
4. Reference notes in code comments when appropriate

## Contributing

To add implementation notes:
1. Create a descriptive markdown file
2. Include code examples and diagrams
3. Explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. Add references to relevant code
5. Update this README
