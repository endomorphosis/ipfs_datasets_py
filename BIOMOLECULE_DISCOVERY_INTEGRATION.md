# Biomolecule Discovery Integration for Protein Binder Design

## Overview
This document describes the RAG-based biomolecule discovery functionality added to support integration with the generative-protein-binder-design package.

## Implementation Summary

### Problem Statement
The user requested help to find candidate biomolecules from scraped medical research datasets using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to support their generative protein binder design workflow.

### Solution Delivered

#### 1. Biomolecule Discovery Engine (`biomolecule_discovery.py` - 25 KB)

**Core Classes:**
- `BiomoleculeDiscoveryEngine` - Main RAG-powered discovery engine
- `BiomoleculeCandidate` - Structured dataclass for discovered biomolecules
- `BiomoleculeType` - Enum for biomolecule types (protein, enzyme, antibody, peptide, inhibitor, etc.)
- `InteractionType` - Enum for interaction types (binding, inhibition, activation, etc.)

**Discovery Methods:**

1. **discover_protein_binders()**
   - Searches PubMed for proteins, antibodies, or peptides that bind to target
   - Uses RAG to extract candidates from research literature
   - Scores based on interaction evidence and context
   - Returns ranked list of BiomoleculeCandidate objects

2. **discover_enzyme_inhibitors()**
   - Searches for small molecules, peptides, or proteins that inhibit target enzyme
   - Filters by enzyme class if specified
   - Extracts inhibitor mentions from abstracts
   - Provides confidence scores based on specificity mentions

3. **discover_pathway_biomolecules()**
   - Discovers components of biological pathways
   - Searches biochemical research using pathway name
   - Can filter by biomolecule types
   - Useful for understanding pathway interactions

**RAG Implementation Details:**
- Leverages existing PubMedScraper and ClinicalTrialsScraper
- Extracts biomolecule names using regex patterns
- Analyzes context to determine biomolecule type
- Calculates confidence scores based on:
  - Interaction type mentions
  - Proximity of target and candidate in text
  - Presence of specificity indicators
  - Number of evidence sources
- Deduplicates candidates and merges evidence
- Returns structured data with metadata

#### 2. MCP Tools Integration

Added 4 new MCP tools to `medical_research_mcp_tools.py`:

```python
def discover_protein_binders(target_protein, interaction_type, min_confidence, max_results)
def discover_enzyme_inhibitors(target_enzyme, enzyme_class, min_confidence, max_results)
def discover_pathway_biomolecules(pathway_name, biomolecule_types, min_confidence, max_results)
def discover_biomolecules_rag(target, discovery_type, max_results, min_confidence)
```

The `discover_biomolecules_rag()` function provides a unified high-level interface.

#### 3. Dashboard API Routes

Added 4 RESTful endpoints to `mcp_dashboard.py`:

- `POST /api/mcp/medicine/discover/protein_binders`
- `POST /api/mcp/medicine/discover/enzyme_inhibitors`
- `POST /api/mcp/medicine/discover/pathway_biomolecules`
- `POST /api/mcp/medicine/discover/biomolecules_rag`

#### 4. Dashboard UI Enhancement

**New Tab:** "Biomolecule Discovery" with DNA icon

**3 Sub-Panels:**

1. **Protein Binders Panel**
   - Target protein input field
   - Interaction type dropdown (binding, inhibition, activation)
   - Min confidence slider (0-1)
   - Max results input
   - Results table showing: name, type, confidence, function, evidence count

2. **Enzyme Inhibitors Panel**
   - Target enzyme input field
   - Optional enzyme class input
   - Min confidence slider
   - Max results input
   - Results table with inhibitor details

3. **Pathway Biomolecules Panel**

   - Max results input (up to 200)
   - Results table with pathway components

**JavaScript Features:**

- Color-coded confidence badges (primary/warning/success)
- Error handling with user feedback

### Example Integration Workflow

```python
# Step 1: Discover candidates using RAG

result = discover_biomolecules_rag(
    target="SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
    discovery_type="binders",
    max_results=50,
    min_confidence=0.7
)

# Step 2: Extract candidate data
candidates = result['candidates']

# Step 3: Pass to generative-protein-binder-design
for candidate in candidates:
    # Each candidate has:
    # - name: biomolecule name
    # - biomolecule_type: protein/antibody/peptide
    # - confidence_score: 0-1
    # - function: description
    # - evidence_sources: list of PMIDs
    # - uniprot_id: if available
    # - sequence: if available
    # - structure: PDB ID if available
    
    # Use candidate as input to protein binder design model
    protein_binder_design_model.generate(
        target="SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
        reference_binder=candidate['name'],
        sequence=candidate.get('sequence'),
        confidence=candidate['confidence_score']
    )
```
