  Vector embedding and similarity operations

  Scenario: Generate embedding for text
    Given a text input
    When embedding generation is requested
    Then a vector embedding is returned

  Scenario: Calculate cosine similarity
    Given two vector embeddings
    When cosine similarity is calculated
    Then a similarity score is returned

  Scenario: Find similar vectors
    Given a query vector and vector database
    When similarity search is performed
    Then the most similar vectors are returned

  Scenario: Store vector embedding
    Given a vector embedding and metadata
    When the vector is stored
    Then the vector is added to the database

  Scenario: Batch generate embeddings
    Given multiple text inputs
    When batch embedding is requested
    Then embeddings for all inputs are returned

  Scenario: Normalize vector
    Given a vector embedding
    When normalization is applied
    Then the vector has unit length

  Scenario: Calculate Euclidean distance
    Given two vector embeddings
    When Euclidean distance is calculated
    Then the distance value is returned

  Scenario: Index vectors for search
    Given a collection of vectors
    When indexing is performed
    Then a searchable index is created

  Scenario: Update vector metadata
    Given an existing vector in the database
    When metadata is updated
    Then the vector metadata is modified

  Scenario: Delete vector from database
    Given a vector ID
    When deletion is requested
    Then the vector is removed from database

  Scenario: Query vectors by metadata filter
    Given a metadata filter criteria
    When filtered query is executed
    Then only matching vectors are returned
