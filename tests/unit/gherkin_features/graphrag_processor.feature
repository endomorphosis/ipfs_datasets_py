Feature: GraphRAG Processor
  Process documents for GraphRAG system

  Scenario: Process document for GraphRAG
    Given a text document
    When GraphRAG processing is applied
    Then entities and relationships are extracted

  Scenario: Chunk document for processing
    Given a long document
    When chunking is applied
    Then the document is split into processable chunks

  Scenario: Extract entities from chunks
    Given document chunks
    When entity extraction is performed
    Then entities are identified in each chunk

  Scenario: Resolve entity references
    Given entities from multiple chunks
    When reference resolution is performed
    Then duplicate entities are merged

  Scenario: Build local knowledge graph
    Given extracted entities and relationships
    When graph construction is requested
    Then a local knowledge graph is built

  Scenario: Integrate with global graph
    Given a local knowledge graph
    When integration is performed
    Then the local graph is merged into global graph

  Scenario: Generate embeddings for entities
    Given extracted entities
    When embedding generation is requested
    Then entity embeddings are created

  Scenario: Index graph for retrieval
    Given a knowledge graph
    When indexing is performed
    Then the graph is indexed for efficient retrieval
