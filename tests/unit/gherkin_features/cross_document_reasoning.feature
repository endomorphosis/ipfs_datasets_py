Feature: Cross-Document Reasoning
  Reasoning across multiple documents

  Scenario: Link related documents
    Given multiple documents
    When cross-document analysis is performed
    Then document relationships are identified

  Scenario: Extract cross-document entities
    Given multiple documents
    When entity extraction is performed
    Then entities mentioned across documents are linked

  Scenario: Identify contradictions across documents
    Given documents with potentially conflicting information
    When contradiction detection is run
    Then contradictions are identified

  Scenario: Build cross-document knowledge graph
    Given multiple documents
    When knowledge graph construction is requested
    Then a unified graph across documents is created

  Scenario: Answer multi-document queries
    Given a query and multiple documents
    When query processing is performed
    Then answers synthesized from multiple documents are returned

  Scenario: Track information flow between documents
    Given documents with citations
    When flow analysis is performed
    Then information flow is mapped

  Scenario: Detect duplicate content across documents
    Given multiple documents
    When duplication detection is run
    Then duplicate content is identified

  Scenario: Merge information from multiple sources
    Given overlapping information in documents
    When information merging is performed
    Then unified information is created
