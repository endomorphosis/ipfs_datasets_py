Feature: Security and Access Control
  Authentication, authorization, and security features

  Scenario: Validate user credentials
    Given user credentials are provided
    When authentication is attempted
    Then the credentials are validated

  Scenario: Generate access token
    Given valid user credentials
    When an access token is requested
    Then a token is generated

  Scenario: Verify access token
    Given an access token exists
    When the token is verified
    Then the token validity is confirmed

  Scenario: Revoke access token
    Given an active access token
    When token revocation is requested
    Then the token is invalidated

  Scenario: Check user permissions
    Given a user and a resource
    When permission check is performed
    Then the permission status is returned

  Scenario: Encrypt sensitive data
    Given plaintext data
    When encryption is applied
    Then encrypted data is returned

  Scenario: Decrypt encrypted data
    Given encrypted data and decryption key
    When decryption is applied
    Then original plaintext is recovered

  Scenario: Hash password
    Given a plaintext password
    When password hashing is applied
    Then a secure password hash is generated

  Scenario: Verify password hash
    Given a password and its hash
    When password verification is performed
    Then the match status is returned

  Scenario: Generate cryptographic signature
    Given data to sign and a private key
    When signature generation is requested
    Then a cryptographic signature is created

  Scenario: Verify cryptographic signature
    Given signed data and a public key
    When signature verification is performed
    Then the signature validity is confirmed
