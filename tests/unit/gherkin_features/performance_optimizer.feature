Feature: Performance Optimization
  System performance monitoring and optimization

  Scenario: Profile operation performance
    Given an operation to profile
    When the operation executes
    Then performance metrics are collected

  Scenario: Identify performance bottlenecks
    Given performance profiling data
    When bottleneck analysis is performed
    Then bottlenecks are identified

  Scenario: Optimize memory usage
    Given high memory consumption
    When optimization is applied
    Then memory usage is reduced

  Scenario: Cache frequent operations
    Given a cacheable operation
    When caching is enabled
    Then operation results are cached

  Scenario: Invalidate cache entries
    Given cached data exists
    When cache invalidation is triggered
    Then cached entries are removed

  Scenario: Optimize query execution
    Given a database query
    When query optimization is applied
    Then execution time is reduced

  Scenario: Enable parallel processing
    Given a parallelizable task
    When parallel execution is enabled
    Then the task runs in parallel

  Scenario: Measure operation latency
    Given an operation
    When latency measurement is enabled
    Then operation latency is recorded

  Scenario: Set performance thresholds
    Given performance threshold values
    When thresholds are configured
    Then alerts trigger when thresholds are exceeded

  Scenario: Generate performance report
    Given collected performance data
    When report generation is requested
    Then a performance report is created

  Scenario: Compare performance metrics
    Given performance data from different runs
    When comparison is performed
    Then performance differences are identified
