Feature: Advanced Performance Optimizer
  Advanced performance optimization strategies

  Scenario: Analyze performance bottlenecks
    Given application performance data
    When bottleneck analysis is performed
    Then performance bottlenecks are identified

  Scenario: Apply query caching
    Given frequent database queries
    When query caching is enabled
    Then query response times improve

  Scenario: Optimize memory allocation
    Given memory usage patterns
    When memory optimization is applied
    Then memory efficiency improves

  Scenario: Enable connection pooling
    Given database connections
    When connection pooling is configured
    Then connection overhead is reduced

  Scenario: Implement lazy loading
    Given resource-intensive operations
    When lazy loading is applied
    Then resources are loaded on demand

  Scenario: Apply data compression
    Given large data transfers
    When compression is enabled
    Then transfer sizes are reduced

  Scenario: Optimize batch processing
    Given batch operations
    When batch optimization is applied
    Then batch throughput improves

  Scenario: Profile code execution
    Given code to profile
    When profiling is enabled
    Then execution hotspots are identified
