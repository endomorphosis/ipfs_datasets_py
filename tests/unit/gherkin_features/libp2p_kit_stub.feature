Feature: LibP2P Kit Stub
  Stub implementation for LibP2P functionality

  Scenario: Initialize stub LibP2P node
    Given stub configuration
    When the stub node is initialized
    Then basic networking is available

  Scenario: Mock peer connections
    Given mock peer information
    When connection is simulated
    Then a mock connection is created

  Scenario: Simulate message passing
    Given mock peers and messages
    When message passing is simulated
    Then messages are exchanged in mock mode

  Scenario: Provide stub discovery
    Given discovery simulation
    When stub discovery runs
    Then mock peers are returned

  Scenario: Return stub peer IDs
    Given stub peer generation
    When peer ID is requested
    Then a mock peer ID is returned

  Scenario: Simulate protocol handlers
    Given protocol handler registration
    When handler is invoked
    Then stub response is returned

  Scenario: Enable testing without network
    Given stub mode enabled
    When network operations are performed
    Then operations complete without actual networking

  Scenario: Validate stub behavior
    Given stub operations
    When validation is performed
    Then stub behavior is correct
