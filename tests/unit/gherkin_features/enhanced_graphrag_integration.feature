Feature: Enhanced GraphRAG Integration
  Enhanced integration for GraphRAG system

  Scenario: Integrate multiple data sources
    Given multiple data sources
    When integration is performed
    Then a unified knowledge graph is created

  Scenario: Synchronize graph updates
    Given updates to data sources
    When synchronization is triggered
    Then the knowledge graph is updated

  Scenario: Query across data sources
    Given an integrated knowledge graph
    And a cross-source query
    When query processing is performed
    Then results from all sources are returned

  Scenario: Resolve entity conflicts
    Given entities from multiple sources
    When conflict resolution is performed
    Then entities are merged or disambiguated

  Scenario: Track data source provenance
    Given graph elements from various sources
    When provenance tracking is enabled
    Then source information is maintained

  Scenario: Apply source-specific transformations
    Given data sources with different formats
    When integration is performed
    Then appropriate transformations are applied

  Scenario: Monitor integration health
    Given an active integration
    When health monitoring runs
    Then integration status is reported

  Scenario: Rollback failed integrations
    Given a failed integration attempt
    When rollback is requested
    Then the graph state is restored
