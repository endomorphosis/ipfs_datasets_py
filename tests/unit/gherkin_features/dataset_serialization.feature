Feature: Dataset Serialization
  Serialize and deserialize datasets in various formats

  Scenario: Serialize dataset to JSON
    Given a dataset object
    When JSON serialization is requested
    Then a JSON representation is created

  Scenario: Deserialize dataset from JSON
    Given a JSON dataset representation
    When deserialization is requested
    Then a dataset object is created

  Scenario: Serialize dataset to Parquet
    Given a dataset object
    When Parquet serialization is requested
    Then a Parquet file is created

  Scenario: Deserialize dataset from Parquet
    Given a Parquet file
    When deserialization is requested
    Then a dataset object is created

  Scenario: Serialize with compression
    Given a dataset and compression setting
    When serialization is performed
    Then the output is compressed

  Scenario: Handle large dataset serialization
    Given a large dataset
    When serialization is performed in chunks
    Then the dataset is serialized without memory overflow

  Scenario: Preserve dataset schema
    Given a dataset with schema
    When serialization and deserialization occur
    Then the schema is preserved

  Scenario: Serialize nested data structures
    Given a dataset with nested fields
    When serialization is performed
    Then nested structures are preserved

  Scenario: Validate serialized format
    Given serialized dataset data
    When validation is performed
    Then the format is confirmed valid

  Scenario: Handle serialization errors
    Given a dataset with invalid data
    When serialization is attempted
    Then errors are reported
