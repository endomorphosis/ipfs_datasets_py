Feature: Data Provenance Tracking
  Track data lineage and transformation history

  Scenario: Record data origin
    Given a data source
    When provenance tracking is initiated
    Then the data origin is recorded

  Scenario: Track data transformation
    Given a data transformation operation
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the transformation is recorded in lineage

  Scenario: Build provenance chain
    Given multiple transformation steps
    When transformations are applied
    Then a complete provenance chain is built

  Scenario: Query data lineage
    Given a dataset with provenance
    When lineage query is executed
    Then the transformation history is returned

  Scenario: Verify data authenticity
    Given a dataset with provenance
    When authenticity check is performed
    Then the authenticity is verified

  Scenario: Export provenance graph
    Given a provenance graph
    When export is requested
    Then the graph is serialized

  Scenario: Track data dependencies
    Given multiple related datasets
    When dependencies are tracked
    Then dependency relationships are recorded

  Scenario: Validate provenance integrity
    Given a provenance chain
    When integrity validation is performed
    Then chain integrity is confirmed
