Feature: Data Provenance Enhanced
  Enhanced data provenance tracking capabilities

  Scenario: Track fine-grained provenance
    Given data transformations
    When fine-grained tracking is enabled
    Then detailed provenance is recorded

  Scenario: Capture computational provenance
    Given computational workflows
    When provenance capture is enabled
    Then computational steps are recorded

  Scenario: Link provenance across systems
    Given data in multiple systems
    When cross-system linking is performed
    Then provenance is linked across systems

  Scenario: Query provenance with reasoning
    Given provenance data and reasoning rules
    When reasoning query is executed
    Then inferred provenance is returned

  Scenario: Validate provenance completeness
    Given a provenance record
    When completeness check is performed
    Then missing provenance is identified

  Scenario: Generate provenance reports
    Given provenance data
    When report generation is requested
    Then detailed provenance reports are created

  Scenario: Annotate provenance with metadata
    Given provenance records
    When metadata annotation is performed
    Then provenance is enriched with metadata

  Scenario: Track provenance permissions
    Given provenance data
    When permission tracking is enabled
    Then access permissions are tracked
