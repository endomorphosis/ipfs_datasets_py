Feature: Complete Advanced GraphRAG
  Complete advanced GraphRAG system implementation

  Scenario: Initialize complete GraphRAG system
    Given system configuration and components
    When the complete system is initialized
    Then all GraphRAG components are ready

  Scenario: Process documents end-to-end
    Given input documents
    When end-to-end processing is requested
    Then documents are processed through entire pipeline

  Scenario: Build comprehensive knowledge graph
    Given processed documents
    When graph construction is requested
    Then a comprehensive knowledge graph is built

  Scenario: Perform advanced retrieval
    Given a knowledge graph and query
    When advanced retrieval is performed
    Then multi-modal retrieval results are returned

  Scenario: Generate context-aware responses
    Given retrieval results and query
    When response generation is requested
    Then context-aware responses are generated

  Scenario: Maintain graph consistency
    Given graph updates
    When consistency checks are performed
    Then graph consistency is maintained

  Scenario: Optimize end-to-end performance
    Given the complete system
    When performance optimization is applied
    Then overall system performance is improved

  Scenario: Handle complex queries
    Given complex multi-part queries
    When query processing is performed
    Then comprehensive answers are generated
