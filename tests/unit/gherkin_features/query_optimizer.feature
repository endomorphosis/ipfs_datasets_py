Feature: Query Optimization
  Optimize database and search queries for performance

  Scenario: Analyze query performance
    Given a database query
    When performance analysis is run
    Then bottlenecks are identified

  Scenario: Generate optimized query plan
    Given a query and database schema
    When query optimization is performed
    Then an optimal execution plan is created

  Scenario: Add index recommendations
    Given query patterns
    When index analysis is performed
    Then index recommendations are provided

  Scenario: Rewrite inefficient query
    Given an inefficient query
    When query rewriting is applied
    Then an equivalent optimized query is generated

  Scenario: Cache query results
    Given a frequently executed query
    When caching is enabled
    Then query results are cached

  Scenario: Invalidate cached queries
    Given cached query results
    When underlying data changes
    Then affected cache entries are invalidated

  Scenario: Optimize join operations
    Given a query with multiple joins
    When join optimization is applied
    Then join order is optimized

  Scenario: Partition query execution
    Given a large dataset query
    When query partitioning is applied
    Then the query executes in parallel partitions

  Scenario: Estimate query cost
    Given a query
    When cost estimation is performed
    Then estimated execution cost is returned

  Scenario: Monitor query performance
    Given query execution
    When monitoring is enabled
    Then execution metrics are collected
