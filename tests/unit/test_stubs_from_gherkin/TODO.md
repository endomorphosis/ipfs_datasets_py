# Test Stub Implementation Progress

This file tracks the implementation of test stub files from Gherkin features.

## Task
Implement 10 test stub files with proper fixtures, step definitions, and @scenario decorators.
Note: Tests are implemented but may not pass - the goal is structure, not passing tests.

## Implementation Status

### Completed (4/10)
1. [x] test___init__.py - Package initialization tests (DONE)
2. [x] test_audit.py - Audit logging tests (DONE)
3. [x] test_config.py - Configuration management tests (DONE)
4. [x] test_vector_tools.py - Vector operations tests (DONE)

### In Progress (0/10)
_Working on remaining 6 files_

### Planned (6/10)
5. [ ] test_car_conversion.py - CAR file conversion tests
6. [ ] test_dataset_manager.py - Dataset lifecycle management tests
7. [ ] test_ipfs_multiformats.py - Content identifier generation tests
8. [ ] test_monitoring.py - System monitoring tests
9. [ ] test_security.py - Security and access control tests
10. [ ] test_web_text_extractor.py - Text extraction from web tests

## Implementation Notes
- Each test file should have:
  - Proper imports from the actual modules
  - @scenario decorators linking to .feature files
  - Fixtures with actual setup/teardown code
  - Step definitions with real implementation
  - Assertions in "then" steps
- Tests may not pass when run - focus is on proper structure
- Original Gherkin text preserved in docstrings
