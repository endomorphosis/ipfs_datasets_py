- [ ] Add parametrized tests for different model configurations

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up pytest configuration for the test suite
- [ ] Configure test discovery and execution patterns

- [ ] Set up test database/fixtures for consistent test data

### Mock and Fixture Setup
- [ ] Mock SentenceTransformer models for embedding tests
- [ ] Mock tiktoken and HuggingFace tokenizers
- [ ] Create sample PDF decomposition data structures
- [ ] Mock file I/O operations for testing
- [ ] Set up asyncio test support for async methods

## Medium Priority

### Test Coverage Enhancement
- [ ] Add integration tests between LLMOptimizer components
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking tests

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [ ] Test network failures during model downloads
- [ ] Test out-of-memory conditions with large documents

- [ ] Create edge case test documents (empty, malformed, etc.)
- [ ] Implement test data versioning and management

## Low Priority

### Test Optimization
- [ ] Optimize test execution speed and reduce redundancy
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution where appropriate
- [ ] Add test result caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Create lightweight mock alternatives for faster testing
- [ ] Implement test data cleanup and resource management

### Documentation and Maintenance
- [ ] Add comprehensive test documentation and examples
- [ ] Create testing guidelines and best practices document
- [ ] Document test data formats and expectations
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common test failures
- [ ] Create test maintenance and update procedures

### Advanced Testing Features
- [ ] Add property-based testing with hypothesis
- [ ] Implement mutation testing for test quality assessment
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting and analysis
- [ ] Create automated test result analysis and reporting
- [ ] Implement test metrics and quality tracking

## Implementation Phase Planning

### Phase 1: Basic Test Implementation
1. Implement LLMOptimizer.__init__ tests
2. Implement _count_tokens and _get_chunk_overlap tests (utility methods)
3. Implement TextProcessor tests (no external dependencies)
4. Implement ChunkOptimizer tests (no external dependencies)

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Tests
1. Implement _extract_structured_text tests
2. Implement _create_chunk tests
3. Implement _establish_chunk_relationships tests
4. Implement _generate_document_summary tests

### Phase 3: Advanced Features Tests
1. Implement _initialize_models tests with mocking
2. Implement _generate_embeddings tests with mock models
3. Implement _generate_document_embedding tests
4. Implement _extract_key_entities tests

### Phase 4: Integration and End-to-End Tests
1. Implement optimize_for_llm tests (main orchestration)
2. Implement _create_optimal_chunks tests (complex integration)
3. Add full pipeline integration tests
4. Performance and stress testing

## Notes
- Follow red-green-refactor methodology strictly
- All tests should fail initially (red phase)
- Implement actual functionality only after tests are written
- Focus on comprehensive edge case coverage
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Mock external dependencies (models, file I/O, network calls)
