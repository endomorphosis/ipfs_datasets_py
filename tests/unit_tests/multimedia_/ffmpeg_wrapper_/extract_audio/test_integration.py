"""
Integration scenarios for FFmpegWrapper.extract_audio method.

This module tests the extract_audio method in combination with
actual FFmpeg operations and filesystem interactions.

Terminology:
- actual_audio_extraction: Testing with real FFmpeg executable and audio processing
- filesystem_audio_creation: Verifying that audio files are actually created with proper format
- audio_quality_preservation: Testing that extracted audio maintains expected quality characteristics
