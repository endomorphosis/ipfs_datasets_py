"""
Edge case scenarios for FFmpegWrapper.is_available method.

This module tests the is_available method with boundary conditions
and edge cases related to dependency availability and system states.

Terminology:
- partial_dependency_availability: System state where some but not all dependencies are available
- dependency_state_change: System environment where dependency availability changes during runtime
- import_failure_conditions: System states where import operations fail for various reasons
