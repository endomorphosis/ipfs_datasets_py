"""
Test suite for MediaProcessor concurrent operation scaling efficiency.

This module tests the concurrent execution capabilities of MediaProcessor,
focusing on performance scaling, resource management, and efficiency metrics.

SHARED DEFINITIONS:
==================

Test Parameters:
- N: Number of concurrent operations ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- MAX_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS: 10 (system resource limit)
- THEORETICAL_SPEEDUP_THRESHOLD: 0.70 (70% efficiency requirement)
- AMDAHL_LAW_SEQUENTIAL_FRACTION: 0.1 (10% sequential overhead)

Timing & Performance:
- Timing precision: ±10ms using time.perf_counter()
- Context switching overhead: ≤5ms per operation transition
- Coordination overhead: ≤20ms for asyncio task management
- Timing tolerance: ±15% variance for concurrent execution
- Memory usage tolerance: ±20% from linear scaling model

Operation Types:
- CPU-bound operations: Video encoding, audio compression, format conversion
  • Characteristics: >80% CPU utilization, minimal I/O wait
  • Thread pool limit: cpu_count() to cpu_count() + 1
  • Examples: FFmpeg encoding, audio transcoding, image processing
- I/O-bound operations: File downloads, uploads, network streaming, disk reads
  • Characteristics: <20% CPU utilization, high I/O wait time
  • Higher concurrency: 50-100 concurrent operations acceptable
  • Examples: HTTP downloads, file uploads, network streaming

Resource Definitions:
- Memory components per operation:
  • Decode buffers: 10-50MB (raw media data during processing)
  • Encode buffers: 5-25MB (output format conversion memory)
  • Metadata storage: ~1MB (file information, processing parameters)
  • Async task overhead: ~100KB (coroutine frames, task objects)
- Connection pool limits:
  • Per-host connections: 10-20 connections
  • Total connections: 100-200 connections
  • Keep-alive duration: 60 seconds
- Disk I/O optimization:
  • SSD queue depth: 4-32 operations
  • HDD queue depth: 1-4 operations
  • I/O coordination threshold: ≥80% of sequential performance

Shared Resources Requiring Synchronization:
- File system: Temporary files, output directories, cache locations
- Network connections: HTTP sessions, connection pools, rate limits
- Memory buffers: Shared decode/encode buffers, cache structures
- External tools: FFmpeg instances, system codecs, hardware accelerators

Concurrency Control Mechanisms:
- Sequential execution: Operations run in series, each waiting for previous
- Concurrent execution: Operations run simultaneously using asyncio primitives
- Concurrency limiting: Token-based control preventing resource oversubscription
- Error isolation: Failure containment preventing cascading effects
- Resource coordination: Synchronization preventing conflicts and corruption

Performance Metrics:
- Efficiency: Ratio of sequential time to concurrent time (speedup factor)
- Throughput: Operations per second, data processed per second
- Latency: Operation start delay, execution time, queue time
- Resource utilization: CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O bandwidth
- Fairness: Balanced execution preventing operation starvation

Timeout & Error Handling:
- Graceful cancellation: Clean termination with proper resource cleanup
- Timeout strategies: Per-operation vs group timeout handling
- Memory pressure detection: <20% available memory triggers reduction
- Concurrency reduction: 25% steps down to 1-2 operations under pressure
- Maximum cleanup time: 30 seconds for resource cleanup operations

Quality Thresholds:
- Efficiency ratio: ≥70% of theoretical maximum (Amdahl's Law)
- Connection reuse rate: ≥70% for operations to same hosts
- CPU utilization target: 90-95% without oversubscription
- Memory monitoring overhead: ≤1% of system resources
- Metrics collection overhead: ≤2% of total execution time
- Scheduling overhead: ≤5% of total execution time
