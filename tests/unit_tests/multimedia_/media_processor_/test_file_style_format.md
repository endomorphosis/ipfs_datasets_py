Based on my examination of the `test_media_processor_status_response_time.py` file, here's the style and format that should be followed:

## Test File Style Definition

### **1. File Structure**
- **Header**: Standard Python shebang and encoding declaration
- **Imports**: Organized sections for standard library, mocking, file validation, target imports, and test utilities
- **Constants Section**: Comprehensive behavioral specification constants with inline comments
- **Single Test Class**: One primary test class per file with descriptive naming

### **2. Behavioral Specification Constants**
- **Quantified Thresholds**: Every behavioral requirement expressed as a measurable constant
- **Descriptive Naming**: Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE with clear, descriptive names
- **Inline Documentation**: Each constant has a comment explaining units and purpose
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Constants for timing, memory, concurrency, throughput, variance, and error handling
- **Example Pattern**:
```python
STATUS_RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD = 5  # milliseconds - maximum acceptable response time
MEMORY_PRESSURE_LOW = 40  # percent - minimum memory utilization for testing
CONCURRENT_REQUEST_COUNT = 10  # simultaneous requests for thread safety testing
```

### **3. Test Class Documentation**
- **Comprehensive Class Docstring**: Multi-paragraph documentation explaining:
  - Purpose and behavioral focus
  - Hardware assumptions and requirements
  - Key behavioral requirements being validated (bulleted list)
  - Test environment assumptions
  - Measurement methodology
- **Behavioral Focus**: Emphasizes observable outcomes over implementation details
- **Performance Context**: Specifies target hardware and performance baselines

### **4. Test Method Structure**
- **Descriptive Naming**: `test_[specific_behavior]_[expected_outcome]` pattern
- **Given-When-Then Format**: Each test docstring follows strict GWT behavioral specification
- **Quantified Expectations**: All assertions reference specific constants and thresholds
- **NotImplementedError Stubs**: All methods raise `NotImplementedError` with descriptive message
- **Example Pattern**:
```python
def test_status_response_time_meets_5ms_threshold(self):
    """
    GIVEN status dictionary generation request
    WHEN measuring response time from request to completion
    THEN expect response time â‰¤ STATUS_RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD under normal operating conditions
    """
    raise NotImplementedError("test_status_response_time_meets_5ms_threshold test needs to be implemented")
```

### **5. Behavioral Testing Philosophy**
- **Observable Outcomes**: Tests validate external behavior, not internal implementation
- **Quantified Requirements**: Every expectation has measurable criteria
- **Real-world Conditions**: Tests consider memory pressure, concurrency, extended operation
- **Performance Focus**: Emphasis on timing, throughput, resource usage, and scaling
- **Error Handling**: Dedicated tests for error condition performance and recovery

### **6. Import Organization**
- Standard library imports first
- Mock/testing imports
- File existence validation
- Target class imports
- Test utility imports

### **7. Metadata Validation**
- **Docstring Quality Test**: Standard test ensuring documentation meets quality standards
- **File Existence Checks**: Validation that source and documentation files exist

This style emphasizes **behavioral specification over implementation testing**, with **comprehensive quantification** of all performance and functional requirements.
