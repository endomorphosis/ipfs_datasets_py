"""
Test suite for MediaProcessor async behavior validation.

This module tests the externally observable async execution capabilities of MediaProcessor,
focusing on thread safety, cancellation handling, and docstring quality.

SHARED DEFINITIONS:
==================

Performance Thresholds:
- EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY: 100ms maximum cancellation response time
- THREAD_SAFETY_TOLERANCE: 0% race condition acceptance for concurrent async calls

Test Coverage:
- Thread safety for concurrent async operations
- Cancellation response time validation  
- Docstring quality standards compliance

Note: This test suite only tests externally observable behavior through the public API
(download_and_convert method and get_capabilities method). Internal implementation
details like blocking time measurements, yield frequencies, and event loop cooperation
are not tested as they cannot be confirmed through external observation.

    This test class validates MediaProcessor's async behavior that can be confirmed

    Test categories:
    - Thread safety validation for concurrent async calls
    - Cancellation response time verification
    - Docstring quality compliance
    
    Shared terminology:
    - "Thread-safe": Concurrent operations complete without race conditions or data corruption
    - "Cancellation response": Time from task.cancel() call until CancelledError handling completes
    - "External behavior": Observable effects through public API methods and their return values
