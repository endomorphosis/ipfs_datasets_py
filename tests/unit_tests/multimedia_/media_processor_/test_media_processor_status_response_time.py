    Behavioral test suite for MediaProcessor status response time requirements.
    
    This test suite validates that the MediaProcessor meets stringent performance
    requirements for status generation operations. The tests focus on observable
    behavioral outcomes rather than implementation details, ensuring that status
    requests complete within defined time thresholds under various operational
    conditions.
    
    The performance requirements are designed for modern desktop hardware
    (2000+ PassMark CPU score, 20+ GB/s memory bandwidth) and ensure that
    status generation remains responsive even under adverse conditions such as
    high memory pressure, concurrent operations, and extended runtime periods.
    
    Key Behavioral Requirements Validated:
    - Status responses complete within STATUS_RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD under normal conditions
    - Performance remains stable during EXTENDED_OPERATION_DURATION operation periods
    - Concurrent access up to CONCURRENT_REQUEST_COUNT simultaneous requests maintains thread safety
    - Memory pressure (MEMORY_PRESSURE_LOW-MEMORY_PRESSURE_HIGH% utilization) doesn't degrade performance >PERFORMANCE_DEGRADATION_THRESHOLD%
    - Batch operations achieve THROUGHPUT_IMPROVEMENT_THRESHOLD%+ throughput improvement over individual requests
    - Cached responses complete CACHE_PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT%+ faster than initial requests
    - Response time variance remains <TIMING_VARIANCE_THRESHOLD% across MEASUREMENT_SAMPLES+ measurement samples
    - System provides actionable feedback when performance thresholds are exceeded
    
    Test Environment Assumptions:
    - Hardware meets minimum performance baselines (i5-8400 equivalent)
    - System memory bandwidth >20 GB/s
    - Storage subsystem capable of sustained I/O operations
    - Operating system with proper scheduling and resource management
    
    Measurement Methodology:
    - Timing precision: TIMING_PRECISION_REQUIRED minimum resolution
    - Baseline establishment: BASELINE_MEASUREMENT_DURATION idle measurement period
    - Statistical validation: Minimum MEASUREMENT_SAMPLES per performance test
    - Variance analysis: Standard deviation calculations for consistency validation
    - Resource monitoring: CPU, memory, and I/O impact measurement during operations
