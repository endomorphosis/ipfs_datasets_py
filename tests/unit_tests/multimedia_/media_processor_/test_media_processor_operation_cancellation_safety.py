        - Resource integrity: Other operations retain access to their allocated resources
        - Performance stability: No performance degradation in continuing operations during cleanup
        - State consistency: Other operations maintain consistent internal state during cancellation
        - Completion success: Non-cancelled operations complete successfully despite concurrent cancellation
        
        CONCURRENCY TESTING APPROACH:
        - Operation setup: Start 5 concurrent operations with different resource profiles
        - Cancellation timing: Cancel operation #3 at 50% completion while others continue
        - Resource monitoring: Track resource usage for all operations throughout cancellation
        - Completion verification: Verify operations #1,2,4,5 complete successfully with expected outputs
        - Isolation validation: Confirm cancelled operation cleanup doesn't affect other operations' resources
        
        IMPLEMENTATION SAFEGUARDS:
        - Registry separation: Each operation maintains independent cleanup registry
        - Resource tagging: Tag all resources with operation ID for accurate cleanup targeting
        - Locking strategy: Use operation-specific locks to prevent cross-operation resource interference
        - Error boundary: Contain cancellation errors within operation scope using try-catch blocks

        - cancellation cleanup: Resource release process following operation termination request
        - non-responsive resources: System resources that don't respond to normal cleanup requests within expected timeframes
        - cleanup timeout: Maximum allowed duration (5000ms) for complete cleanup sequence completion
        - approached: Cleanup duration exceeding 80% of timeout limit (4000ms) triggering escalation
        - escalated cleanup methods: More aggressive resource release techniques used when normal methods fail
        - SIGKILL: Unix signal 9 for forced process termination without allowing cleanup handlers
        - forced deletion: File removal using elevated permissions or system-level operations
        
        ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
        - Subprocess timeout: Process doesn't terminate within 3000ms of SIGTERM signal
        - File deletion timeout: File removal operations taking >1000ms per file
        - Network timeout: Connection closure taking >1000ms per connection
        - Handle timeout: File descriptor release taking >500ms
        - Memory timeout: Memory cleanup not completing within 500ms
        
        ESCALATED CLEANUP METHODS:
        1. Process escalation: SIGTERM â†’ wait 3000ms â†’ SIGKILL â†’ wait 1000ms â†’ mark failed
        2. File escalation: os.unlink() â†’ chmod 0o600 + unlink â†’ force deletion â†’ mark failed
        3. Network escalation: graceful close â†’ socket shutdown â†’ force close â†’ mark failed
        4. Handle escalation: file.close() â†’ os.close(fd) â†’ mark leaked â†’ continue
        5. Memory escalation: gc.collect() â†’ manual buffer clearing â†’ accept leakage â†’ continue
        
        TIMEOUT MONITORING:
        - Phase timeouts: Track elapsed time for each cleanup category independently
        - Total timeout: Monitor overall cleanup duration against 5000ms limit
        - Escalation points: Trigger escalated methods at 75% of per-category timeout
        - Abandonment threshold: Mark resources as leaked if escalation also fails
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
        - Timeout detection: Use asyncio.wait_for() or threading.Timer for timeout enforcement
        - Escalation sequence: Implement graduated response with increasing aggressiveness
        - Resource tagging: Mark stubborn resources for later cleanup attempts or monitoring
        - Graceful degradation: Accept partial cleanup rather than infinite waiting
        - Security considerations: Ensure SIGKILL and forced deletion don't compromise system security
        
        LOGGING AND MONITORING:
        - Escalation events: Log when normal cleanup methods fail and escalation begins
        - Resource identification: Record specific resources requiring escalated cleanup
        - Success rates: Track effectiveness of different escalation methods
        - Performance impact: Monitor system impact of escalated cleanup methods

        WHERE:
        - cancellation cleanup failure: Inability to successfully release specific resource despite escalated attempts
        - specific resource: Individual system resource (process, file, connection, handle, memory) that cannot be cleaned
        - MediaProcessor: Media processing class implementing fault-tolerant cleanup with degradation strategies
        - cannot complete: Cleanup attempts exhausted without achieving clean cancellation criteria
        - clean cancellation: Perfect cleanup meeting all 5 criteria within timeout constraints
        - graceful degradation: Controlled failure handling that minimizes system impact while accepting partial cleanup
        - best-effort cleanup: Maximum achievable cleanup given resource constraints and failure conditions
        
        DEGRADATION STRATEGY:

        - Resource isolation: Quarantine failed resources to prevent impact on future operations
        - Partial success: Mark operation as partially cleaned rather than completely failed
        - Error documentation: Log specific failure reasons and resource details for troubleshooting
        - Resource tracking: Maintain registry of leaked resources for later cleanup attempts
        
        FAILURE SCENARIOS AND RESPONSES:
        1. Stubborn subprocess: Mark as leaked, add to zombie process monitor, continue with other cleanup
        2. Locked files: Mark as orphaned, schedule retry in background, continue with remaining files
        3. Stuck connections: Mark as leaked, monitor for eventual timeout, continue with other connections
        4. Leaked handles: Document handle count deviation, continue operation, alert monitoring
        5. Memory retention: Accept memory increase, trigger garbage collection, continue operation
        
        DEGRADATION LEVELS:
        - Level 1 (Minor): 1 category failed, 4 categories successful, operation continues normally
        - Level 2 (Moderate): 2 categories failed, 3 categories successful, operation continues with warnings
        - Level 3 (Major): 3+ categories failed, <3 categories successful, operation flagged for investigation
        - Level 4 (Critical): All categories failed, operation marked as resource leak risk
        
        BEST-EFFORT IMPLEMENTATION:
        - Timeout respect: Honor overall cleanup timeout even with partial success
        - Error aggregation: Collect all cleanup errors for comprehensive failure reporting
        - Resource accounting: Maintain accurate count of cleaned vs leaked resources
        - Retry scheduling: Schedule background cleanup attempts for recoverable failures
        - System monitoring: Alert external monitoring systems about resource leaks
        
        OPERATIONAL IMPACT:
        - Performance degradation: Accept reduced performance rather than operation failure
        - Resource monitoring: Increase monitoring frequency for leaked resources
        - Cleanup scheduling: Background cleanup processes target leaked resources
        - Capacity planning: Account for leaked resources in system capacity calculations

        WHEN MediaProcessor terminates subprocesses
        THEN expect proper process reaping to prevent zombie processes
        
        WHERE:
        - subprocess termination: Process shutdown sequence for child processes (FFmpeg, yt-dlp) during cancellation
        - cancellation: Operation termination request requiring immediate subprocess cleanup
        - MediaProcessor: Media processing class responsible for proper subprocess lifecycle management
        - terminates: Requests process shutdown via signal delivery and monitors completion
        - subprocesses: Child processes spawned via subprocess.Popen() for external tool execution
        - proper process reaping: Collection of child process exit status to prevent zombie state
        - prevent: Proactively avoid through correct process management rather than reactive cleanup
        - zombie processes: Terminated processes whose exit status hasn't been collected by parent process
        
        ZOMBIE PREVENTION REQUIREMENTS:
        - Exit status collection: Call process.wait() or process.poll() to collect exit status
        - Signal handling: Install SIGCHLD handler to automatically reap terminated children
        - Process monitoring: Track all spawned subprocess PIDs for comprehensive reaping
        - Timeout enforcement: Force reaping within 1000ms of subprocess termination
        - Parent responsibility: Ensure MediaProcessor acts as responsible parent process
        
        REAPING PROCESS:
        1. Subprocess termination: Send SIGTERM to child process
        2. Termination monitoring: Poll process.poll() for exit status availability
        3. Status collection: Call process.wait() or process.communicate() to collect exit status
        4. Resource cleanup: Close subprocess stdin/stdout/stderr pipes
        5. Registry update: Remove reaped process from active subprocess registry
        6. Zombie verification: Confirm process not in zombie state via system monitoring
        
        VERIFICATION METHODS:
        - Process state: Check /proc/PID/stat shows state != 'Z' (zombie) on Unix systems
        - System monitoring: Use ps command to verify no zombie processes with MediaProcessor parent
        - Exit status: Verify process.returncode is set to valid exit code (not None)
        - Resource release: Confirm subprocess file descriptors and memory released
        - Parent-child relationship: Verify subprocess properly removed from process tree
        
        PLATFORM-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION:
        - Unix/Linux: Use process.wait() and SIGCHLD signal handling for automatic reaping
        - Windows: Use process.wait() as SIGCHLD not available, rely on polling for completion
        - macOS: Similar to Linux with process.wait() and signal handling
        - Cross-platform: Use subprocess.communicate() or process.wait() for portable reaping
        
        ERROR HANDLING:
        - Reaping timeout: If process.wait() blocks, use process.poll() and force cleanup
        - Signal delivery failure: If SIGTERM fails, escalate to SIGKILL and attempt reaping
        - Zombie detection: Monitor for zombie state and attempt additional reaping if detected
        - System limits: Handle case where system process table full prevents proper reaping
