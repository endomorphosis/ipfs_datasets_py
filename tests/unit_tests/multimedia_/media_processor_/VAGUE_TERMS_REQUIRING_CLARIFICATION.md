# MediaProcessor Test Suite - Term Definitions and Standards

*Version 1.0 - July 31, 2025*

## 1. Performance Thresholds & Timing

### Time Values
- **100ms validation threshold**: Maximum time allowed for input validation operations. Measured from method entry to validation completion on reference hardware (Intel i7-8700K, 16GB RAM, SSD).
- **5-second DNS timeout**: Maximum wait time for DNS resolution before considering the lookup failed. Based on 99.9th percentile of global DNS response times plus 2x safety margin.
- **500ms 99th percentile threshold**: 99% of operations must complete within 500ms under standard load (100 concurrent operations). Remaining 1% must complete within 2000ms.
- **60-second measurement interval**: Performance metrics are aggregated over 60-second windows to smooth out transient spikes while capturing meaningful trends.
- **30-second operation timeout**: Hard limit for any single media processing operation. Operations exceeding this are forcibly terminated and logged as failures.

### Performance Criteria
- **Reasonable response time**: ≤250ms for UI feedback, ≤1000ms for file operations, ≤5000ms for network operations
- **Acceptable performance**: Meeting all defined SLAs: 99% uptime, <500ms p99 latency, <5% CPU usage at idle
