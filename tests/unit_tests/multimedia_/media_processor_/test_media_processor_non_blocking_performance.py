"""
Test suite for MediaProcessor non-blocking performance characteristics.

This module tests the async execution capabilities of MediaProcessor,
focusing on non-blocking behavior, event loop cooperation, and performance guarantees.

SHARED DEFINITIONS:
==================

Performance Thresholds:
- MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS: 10ms maximum continuous blocking time per method execution
- EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY: 100ms maximum between event loop yields
- BLOCKING_DETECTION_PRECISION: ±2ms measurement accuracy tolerance
- THREAD_SAFETY_TOLERANCE: 0% race condition acceptance for concurrent async calls

Behavioral Requirements by Operation Category:
- File I/O operations: Reading, writing, seeking, directory operations
  • Behavior: Complete within MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS without blocking event loop
  • Yield requirement: Return control within EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY
- Network operations: HTTP requests, API calls, downloads, uploads
  • Behavior: Complete within MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS without blocking event loop
  • Yield requirement: Return control within EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY
- Subprocess operations: External process execution, command-line tools
  • Behavior: Complete within MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS without blocking event loop
  • Yield requirement: Return control within EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY
- Sleep/delay operations: Timed delays, rate limiting, retry backoff
  • Behavior: Yield control within EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY
  • Timing requirement: Respect configured delay duration ±BLOCKING_DETECTION_PRECISION
- CPU-intensive operations: Heavy computation, cryptographic operations, encoding
  • Behavior: Complete within MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS without blocking event loop
  • Execution requirement: Offload to avoid main thread blocking

Async Behavioral Patterns:
- Resource management: Complete within MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS
- Progress reporting: Operate without blocking main thread
- Cancellation handling: Respond within EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY
- Timeout enforcement: Operate within configured bounds ±BLOCKING_DETECTION_PRECISION
- Event loop validation: Operate with 0% failure rate
- Concurrent execution: Maintain THREAD_SAFETY_TOLERANCE (0% race conditions)

Measurement Methodologies:
- Blocking time measurement: Achieve BLOCKING_DETECTION_PRECISION (±2ms)
- Thread safety validation: Concurrent execution without race conditions
- Continuous blocking detection: Identify uninterrupted main thread occupation periods
- Event loop yield verification: Track control return frequency to event loop
- Memory tracking: Monitor resource usage during async operations
- Performance overhead: Async implementation ≤ 15% overhead vs synchronous

Quality Standards:
- Non-blocking guarantee: All I/O and waiting operations yield control properly
- Response time: Method initiation ≤ 5ms, first yield ≤ 10ms
- Resource cleanup: Complete within MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS for all acquired resources
- Error handling: Maintain async exception propagation and cleanup performance
- Platform compatibility: Consistent behavior across Windows, Linux, macOS
- Performance overhead: Async implementation ≤ 15% overhead vs synchronous

Edge Cases & Error Conditions:
- Event loop unavailability: Graceful handling when no event loop available
- Cancellation during operations: Clean resource cleanup within EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY
- Timeout scenarios: Cleanup completion within MAX_BLOCKING_TIME_MS when operations exceed limits
- Resource exhaustion: Backpressure response within EVENT_LOOP_YIELD_FREQUENCY
- Platform differences: Consistent behavior across operating system variations
