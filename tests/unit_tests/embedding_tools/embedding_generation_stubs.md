    Generate a single vector embedding for text using the integrated IPFS embeddings core.
    
    This function provides high-level access to embedding generation capabilities for single
    text inputs. It leverages the IPFS embeddings framework to generate dense vector 
    representations that capture semantic meaning of the input text. The function includes
    comprehensive error handling, input validation, and fallback mechanisms for testing
    environments where full embedding dependencies may not be available.

    The generated embeddings can be used for semantic similarity comparisons, document
    clustering, information retrieval, and other natural language processing tasks.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input text string to generate an embedding for. Must be non-empty

            preferred for cosine similarity calculations. Defaults to True.
        batch_size (int, optional): The batch size for internal processing. While this
            function processes single texts, the underlying engine may use batching
            for efficiency. Defaults to 32.
        use_gpu (bool, optional): Whether to enable GPU acceleration for embedding
            generation if CUDA-compatible hardware is available. Defaults to False.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the underlying embedding engine.
            May include model-specific parameters, caching options, or performance tuning.

        Execute the batch embedding generation tool with MCP-compatible interface.

        This method provides the primary execution interface for batch processing within
        MCP tool environments, accepting a list of texts and optional parameters before
        delegating to the underlying generate_batch_embeddings function. It ensures
        full compatibility with MCP execution patterns while providing access to all
        batch processing optimizations and features.

        Args:
            texts (List[str]): List of text strings to generate embeddings for. Each
                text must be valid and within model input limitations. The list cannot
                be empty and should respect the max_texts limitation for optimal performance.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed through to the underlying
                generate_batch_embeddings function, including model_name, normalize,
                batch_size, use_gpu, max_texts, and other batch processing parameters.

            - MemoryError: For excessive batch sizes or memory constraints
            - TypeError: For incorrect parameter types or formats

    Return comprehensive list of available embedding tools for MCP server registration.
    
    This function provides a standardized interface for MCP servers to discover and
    register all available embedding generation tools. It returns a structured list
    containing tool metadata, descriptions, and function references that enable
    automatic tool registration and invocation within MCP server environments.

    The function serves as the primary integration point between the embedding
    generation module and MCP server infrastructure, ensuring consistent tool
    discovery and registration across different server implementations.
