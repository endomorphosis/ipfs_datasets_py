## Implementation Tasks

### High Priority - Core Test Implementation
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorInitialization with mock IPLDStorage
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorIntegrateDocument with complex workflow mocking
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorQueryGraph with entity matching and filtering logic
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorGetEntityNeighborhood with NetworkX graph traversal
- [ ] Set up proper mock fixtures for LLMDocument, Entity, Relationship, and KnowledgeGraph classes

### Medium Priority - Entity and Relationship Extraction
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorExtractEntitiesFromChunks with entity consolidation logic
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorExtractEntitiesFromText with regex pattern testing
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorExtractRelationships with relationship coordination
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorExtractChunkRelationships with co-occurrence testing
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorExtractCrossChunkRelationships with narrative sequence logic

### Medium Priority - Graph Processing
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorCreateNetworkXGraph with NetworkX DiGraph testing
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorMergeIntoGlobalGraph with graph composition
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorDiscoverCrossDocumentRelationships with entity linking
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorFindSimilarEntities with similarity matching
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorCalculateTextSimilarity with Jaccard coefficient

### Low Priority - Utilities and Storage
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorInferRelationshipType with keyword matching
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorFindChunkSequences with page grouping logic
- [ ] Implement TestGraphRAGIntegratorStoreKnowledgeGraphIpld with IPLD storage mocking

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create comprehensive mock factories for all data classes
- [ ] Set up test data generators for realistic entity and relationship scenarios
- [ ] Implement test utilities for NetworkX graph validation
- [ ] Create fixtures for complex knowledge graph structures
- [ ] Set up async test harness for all async methods

### Test Data and Fixtures
- [ ] Create sample LLMDocument instances with realistic content
- [ ] Generate test entities with various types (person, organization, location, etc.)
- [ ] Create test relationships with different types and confidence scores
- [ ] Build sample chunk sequences for cross-chunk relationship testing
- [ ] Prepare test cases for edge conditions (empty inputs, malformed data)

### Validation and Quality
- [ ] Add property-based testing for similarity calculations
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks for large graph operations
- [ ] Add integration tests with real IPLD storage
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests with complete document processing pipeline
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting and quality gates

### Documentation
- [ ] Document test patterns and conventions used
- [ ] Create testing guide for contributors
- [ ] Add examples of how to extend tests for new features
- [ ] Document mock usage patterns and best practices
