Playwright E2E tests for Municipal Codes Scraper MCP Tool in Dashboard UI.

This test suite validates the integration of the scrape_municipal_codes MCP tool
in the dashboard, including:
- UI element rendering
- JavaScript SDK integration
- MCP tool invocation
- Results display
- Error handling

Test Coverage:
- Municipal Codes tab navigation
- Form input validation
- Tool execution via MCP API
- Results rendering
- Screenshot capture for validation
