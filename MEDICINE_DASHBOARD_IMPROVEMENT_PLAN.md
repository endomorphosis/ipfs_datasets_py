## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Fallback Mechanisms
**Decision:** Implement multiple fallback strategies for each scraper

**Rationale:**
- Medical research is critical data
- API rate limits and failures are common
- Offline capability important for reliability

**Implementation:**
- Primary: Direct API access
- Secondary: Alternative APIs or FTP
- Tertiary: Archive.org Wayback Machine
- Quaternary: Local IPFS cache

### 2. Fuzzy Logic for Medical Reasoning
**Decision:** Use fuzzy logic instead of boolean logic

**Rationale:**
- Medical relationships are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Need to express degrees of certainty
- Better matches real-world medical decision-making

**Implementation:**
- Confidence levels (very_high to very_low)
- Fuzzy membership functions
- Probability distributions for outcomes

### 3. Temporal Constraints
**Decision:** Include temporal information in all theorems

**Rationale:**
- Time is critical in medical causation
- Need to distinguish immediate vs delayed effects
- Support time-series validation

**Implementation:**
- Time-to-effect field
- Duration field
- Temporal windows
- Time-series validator

### 4. Population Scoping
**Decision:** Include population demographics in theorems

**Rationale:**
- Medical effects vary by demographics
- Need population-specific reasoning
- Support personalized medicine

**Implementation:**
- Age distribution tracking
- Sex/gender considerations
- Ethnicity/race data
- Comorbidity information

- Implement request throttling in scrapers

### Caching Strategy
- Cache scraped data to reduce API calls
- Store in IPFS for persistence
- Implement TTL for cache expiration

### Scalability
- Batch processing for large queries

- Only public research and trial metadata
- Aggregate population data only

### API Keys
- Secure storage of NCBI API keys

## Conclusion

This comprehensive improvement plan establishes a robust medical research data infrastructure for the medicine dashboard. The implementation leverages multiple data sources with fallback mechanisms, implements sophisticated theorem generation and validation using fuzzy logic, and provides an intuitive UI for medical researchers and practitioners to explore and reason about medical knowledge.

The system is designed to support the generation and validation of temporal deontic logic theorems from empirical medical data, enabling sophisticated medical reasoning such as "If intervention X is applied to population Y with condition Z, outcome W is expected within time T with confidence C."

All core components are now implemented and integrated into the MCP server dashboard, ready for testing and iterative enhancement.
