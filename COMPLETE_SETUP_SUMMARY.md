# Or manually
docker run --rm ipfs-datasets-py:minimal-x86
```

### Docker Compose
```bash
# Validate
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml config

# Run services
docker compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d
```

   - Builds on self-hosted ARM64 (if available)
   - Multi-arch images (amd64 + arm64)
   - Publishes to GitHub Container Registry

2. **`.github/workflows/gpu-tests.yml`** ⭐ NEW
   - Runs GPU tests on your self-hosted runner
   - Runs CPU tests on GitHub-hosted runners (in parallel)
   - Shows GPU info and memory usage
   - Docker GPU tests included

## 🎮 Part 3: GPU-Enabled Self-Hosted Runner

### Your GPU Advantage
- 2x RTX 3090 = Perfect for ML/AI testing
- Direct hardware access = Faster than cloud
- No GPU quotas or limits
- Test models that need 48GB VRAM

### Quick Setup (3 Steps)

#### Step 1: Test (Optional)
```bash
bash test_gpu_setup.sh
```
This verifies:
- GPU is accessible
- Docker can use GPU
- PyTorch GPU works

#### Step 2: Set Up Runner
```bash
bash setup_gpu_runner.sh
```
You'll need a token from:
https://github.com/endomorphosis/ipfs_datasets_py/settings/actions/runners/new

Or manually follow: `GPU_RUNNER_SETUP.md`

#### Step 3: Commit & Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Docker + GitHub Actions + GPU runner support"
git push
```

## 📝 How to Use GPU in Tests

### Mark Tests for GPU
```python
import pytest
import torch

@pytest.mark.gpu
def test_model_training():
    """This runs on your GPU runner"""
    assert torch.cuda.is_available()
    model = MyModel().cuda()
    # ... train on GPU

@pytest.mark.multi_gpu
def test_distributed():
    """This uses both RTX 3090s"""
    assert torch.cuda.device_count() >= 2
    # ... distributed training

def test_data_processing():
    """This runs on GitHub's free runner"""
    # ... CPU only test
```

### Run Tests Locally
```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/

# GPU tests only
pytest tests/ -m gpu

# Skip GPU tests
pytest tests/ -m "not gpu"

# Multi-GPU tests
pytest tests/ -m multi_gpu
```

## 💡 Key Features

### Multi-Platform Support
- ✅ x86_64 (tested locally)
- ✅ ARM64 (via QEMU or self-hosted)
- ✅ Both in parallel

### Intelligent Test Distribution
- 🖥️ CPU tests → GitHub-hosted (free)
- 🎮 GPU tests → Your RTX 3090s (fast & powerful)
- 🔄 Both run in parallel

### Automatic Fallbacks
- No GPU runner? Tests run as CPU-only
- No self-hosted runner? Uses GitHub-hosted
- Graceful degradation everywhere

### Rich Reporting
```
📊 Test Summary
├─ CPU Tests: ✅ 150/150 passed (GitHub runner)
├─ GPU Tests: ✅ 25/25 passed (RTX 3090)
└─ Docker: ✅ Built for linux/amd64, linux/arm64

🎮 GPU Usage
├─ GPU 0: 2.3GB / 24GB (RTX 3090)
└─ GPU 1: 0.1GB / 24GB (RTX 3090)
```

---

## 🔒 Security

✅ **Safe Practices:**
- Runner only runs your code
- Docker containers isolated
- GPU access controlled
- Secrets managed properly

⚠️ **Remember:**
- Only use runner with repos you control
- Monitor GPU temperature and usage
- Keep drivers/Docker updated
- Review runner logs regularly
