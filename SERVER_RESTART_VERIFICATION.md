# MCP Server Restart and Verification - COMPLETED

## Issue Identified and Fixed

During the cleanup process, two critical dependency files were accidentally moved to the archive:

1. **`requirements.txt`** - Moved from root to `archive/migration_artifacts/`
2. **`package.json`** - Moved from root to `archive/migration_artifacts/`

## Resolution Actions Taken

✅ **Files Restored**:
- Copied `requirements.txt` back to root directory
- Copied `package.json` back to root directory

✅ **Dependencies Reinstalled**:
- Ran `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all Python dependencies are available

✅ **Tools Verified**:
- All 5 development tools import successfully
- All tools execute properly
- MCP server registration working correctly

## Verification Results

### Development Tools Status: ✅ ALL WORKING
- `test_generator` ✅
- `documentation_generator` ✅ 
- `codebase_search` ✅
- `linting_tools` ✅
- `test_runner` ✅

### MCP Server Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- Server imports successfully
- All tools register correctly
- Tool execution working properly

## Server Start Commands

### For VS Code Integration (Recommended):
```bash
cd /home/barberb/ipfs_datasets_py
python -m ipfs_datasets_py.mcp_server --stdio
```

### For HTTP Testing:
```bash
cd /home/barberb/ipfs_datasets_py  
python -m ipfs_datasets_py.mcp_server --http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The cleanup process was overly aggressive in moving files to the archive. The `CLEANUP_PLAN.md` correctly identified `requirements.txt` and `package.json` as files to "KEEP IN ROOT", but they were moved anyway.

## Prevention

Updated cleanup documentation to emphasize that dependency files must never be moved, as they are critical for proper system operation.

## Final Status: ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED

All development tools and the MCP server are now working properly after restoring the critical dependency files. The system is ready for production use with VS Code integration.
