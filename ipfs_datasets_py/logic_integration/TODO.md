# TODO List for logic_integration/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 75**: Complete TDD tasks for logic_integration/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: LOGIC_INTEGRATION DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The logic_integration directory contains comprehensive logic verification and symbolic logic implementations

## Current State Summary
- logic_verification.py contains multiple dataclasses and LogicVerifier class:
  - VerificationResult (enum), LogicAxiom, ProofStep, ProofResult, ConsistencyCheck, EntailmentResult (dataclasses)
  - LogicVerifier (comprehensive implementation)
  - Symbol and Expression mock classes for development
- modal_logic_extension.py contains ModalLogicSymbol, AdvancedLogicConverter, ModalFormula, LogicClassification
- symbolic_logic_primitives.py contains symbolic logic primitives
- symbolic_fol_bridge.py contains first-order logic bridge functionality
- symbolic_contracts.py contains symbolic contract implementations
- interactive_fol_constructor.py contains interactive first-order logic constructor
- tests/ subdirectory contains test implementations
- Directory has comprehensive logic verification and symbolic reasoning capabilities
- Worker 75 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

- [ ] Enhance existing tests in tests/ subdirectory

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
