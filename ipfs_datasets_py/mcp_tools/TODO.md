# TODO List for mcp_tools/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 71**: Complete TDD tasks for mcp_tools/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: MCP_TOOLS DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The mcp_tools directory contains comprehensive MCP tool registry and validation implementations

## Current State Summary
- tool_registry.py contains ClaudeMCPTool (abstract base class) and ToolRegistry classes
- validators.py contains ValidationError and ParameterValidator classes
- tools/ subdirectory contains additional tool implementations
- Directory has working MCP tool framework with registry and validation systems
- Worker 71 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - MCP Tools Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] mcp_tools/tool_registry.py
    - [x] ClaudeMCPTool (abstract base class for MCP tools)
    - [x] ToolRegistry (centralized registry for MCP tools)

- [x] mcp_tools/validators.py
    - [x] ValidationError (custom exception class)
    - [x] ParameterValidator (parameter validation class)

- [x] mcp_tools/tools/ (additional tool implementations in subdirectory)

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 71
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for ClaudeMCPTool abstract base class
- [ ] Add tests for ToolRegistry class methods
- [ ] Add tests for ParameterValidator class
- [ ] Add tests for ValidationError exception handling
- [ ] Create integration tests for MCP tool registration and execution
- [ ] Add tests for tool discovery and management
- [ ] Test validation workflows and error handling
- [ ] Add tests for tools in the tools/ subdirectory

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
