# TODO List for vector_stores/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 63**: Complete TDD tasks for vector_stores/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-02
**Status**: VECTOR_STORES DIRECTORY FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for vector store classes that are already comprehensively implemented
**Resolution**: The vector_stores directory contains complete implementations of all major vector store types

## Current State Summary
- base.py contains BaseVectorStore abstract base class with full interface
- faiss_store.py contains FAISSVectorStore implementation
- elasticsearch_store.py contains ElasticsearchVectorStore implementation  
- qdrant_store.py contains QdrantVectorStore implementation
- All vector store classes inherit from BaseVectorStore and implement required methods
- Directory has comprehensive error handling (VectorStoreError, VectorStoreConnectionError, VectorStoreOperationError)
- Worker 63 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - Vector Store Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] vector_stores/base.py
    - [x] BaseVectorStore (abstract base class)
    - [x] VectorStoreError
    - [x] VectorStoreConnectionError  
    - [x] VectorStoreOperationError

- [x] vector_stores/faiss_store.py
    - [x] FAISSVectorStore (complete implementation)

- [x] vector_stores/elasticsearch_store.py
    - [x] ElasticsearchVectorStore (complete implementation)

- [x] vector_stores/qdrant_store.py
    - [x] QdrantVectorStore (complete implementation)

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 63
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for FAISSVectorStore
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for ElasticsearchVectorStore
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for QdrantVectorStore
- [ ] Create integration tests between different vector store backends
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for different vector stores
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases for the existing implementations

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
