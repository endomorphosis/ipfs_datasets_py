## Summary
An epic mythological battle scene depicting two powerful deities reaching toward each other as lightning explodes between them. The left figure emanates blue lightning and wears white robes, while the right figure is surrounded by pink/red energy and wears darker attire. The scene is split between two realms - one side shows Greek-style temples with blue skies, the other shows similar architecture bathed in pink light. Below them, crowds of robed figures witness the divine confrontation. The overall composition creates a dramatic clash between opposing forces, with the central lightning bolt dividing the image into two distinct color palettes.
