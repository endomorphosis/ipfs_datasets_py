class ChunkMetrics:
    """
    Comprehensive quality metrics for evaluating text chunk characteristics.

    The ChunkMetrics dataclass encapsulates multiple dimensions of chunk quality assessment,
    providing a standardized structure for storing and comparing chunk evaluation results.
    Each metric represents a different aspect of chunk quality, with scores normalized to
    a 0.0-1.0 range for easy comparison and aggregation.

    This dataclass is used by the ChunkOptimizer to quantify the suitability of text chunks
    for LLM processing, enabling data-driven decisions about chunk selection, ordering, and
    optimization. The metrics balance various quality aspects to ensure chunks are both
    rich in information and structurally sound.

    Attributes:
        coherence_score (float): Measure of logical flow and sentence connectivity within
            the chunk. Based on transition word usage and referential elements like pronouns.
            Range: 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 indicates excellent flow with clear connections.
        
        completeness_score (float): Measure of structural completeness, evaluating whether
            sentences and thoughts are properly concluded. Based on punctuation patterns
            and sentence boundaries. Range: 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 indicates all sentences
            are properly formed and ended.
        
        length_score (float): Measure of size appropriateness relative to configured
            boundaries (min_size, max_size). Optimal at the midpoint between boundaries.
            Range: 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 indicates ideal length for processing.
        
        semantic_density (float): Measure of information richness, calculating the ratio
            of meaningful content words to total words and vocabulary diversity.
            Range: 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 indicates high information content with minimal filler.
        
        overall_quality (float): Weighted aggregate of all metrics providing a single
            quality indicator. Calculated as: coherence*0.3 + completeness*0.25 + 
            length*0.25 + density*0.2. Range: 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 indicates excellent
            overall quality.

    Usage Example:
        >>> metrics = ChunkMetrics(
        ...     coherence_score=0.85,
        ...     completeness_score=0.92,
        ...     length_score=0.78,
        ...     semantic_density=0.81,
        ...     overall_quality=0.84
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Overall quality: {metrics.overall_quality:.2%}")
        84.00%
        >>> 
        >>> # Compare chunks
        >>> if chunk1.metrics.overall_quality > chunk2.metrics.overall_quality:
        ...     print("Chunk 1 is higher quality")

    Notes:
        - All scores are normalized to 0.0-1.0 for consistency
        - Overall quality weights are fixed and not configurable
        - Higher scores always indicate better quality
        - Scores are calculated independently but may correlate
        - No validation is performed on score ranges in the dataclass

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Add validation to ensure scores are within 0.0-1.0 range
        - Include confidence intervals or standard deviations for scores
        - Add timestamp for when metrics were calculated
        - Include raw component scores before weighting
        - Add comparison methods (__lt__, __gt__, etc.) for sorting
        - Include metric calculation parameters for reproducibility
        - Add optional metadata fields for debugging
        - Consider making overall_quality a computed property
        - Add method to recalculate overall_quality with custom weights
        - Include explanations for why certain scores are low

class ChunkOptimizer:
    """
    Advanced Chunk Optimization for LLM Consumption

    The ChunkOptimizer class provides sophisticated text chunking strategies optimized for
    Large Language Model (LLM) processing (text analysis tasks including summarization, 
    question-answering, content generation, and information extraction). It creates, evaluates, 
    and optimizes text chunks to maximize coherence, completeness, and semantic density while 
    respecting size constraints defined by LLM context windows (maximum tokens processable: 
    GPT-3.5: 4,096, GPT-4: 8,192-32,768, Claude: 100,000+).

    This class implements multiple chunking algorithms including structure-aware (preserves 
    paragraph boundaries, better for documents/articles) and sliding window approaches 
    (uniform sizes, better for continuous prose), with comprehensive quality scoring for 
    each chunk. The optimizer preserves narrative flow 
    (pronoun references to earlier entities, transition words connecting sentences, 
    consistent temporal sequence, cause-effect relationships.) and 
    semantic boundaries (end of concepts, topic shifts, logical conclusions)) 
    while ensuring chunks remain within LLM context windows.

    Args:
        max_size (int, optional): Maximum size of each chunk in words (tokens ≈ words x 1.3 
            for English). This defines the upper boundary for chunk size to fit within LLM
            context windows. Should be set based on the target LLM's token limits.
            Defaults to 2048.
        overlap (int, optional): Number of words to overlap between consecutive chunks.
            Overlap helps maintain context continuity across chunk boundaries. The actual 
            overlap used is overlap/4 (conservative approach) to prevent excessive redundancy.
            Recommended: overlap ≤ max_size x 0.3. Defaults to 200.
        min_size (int, optional): Minimum acceptable size for a chunk in words.
            Chunks smaller than this are candidates for merging with adjacent chunks.
            Recommended: min_size ≥ max_size x 0.1. Defaults to 100.

    Key Features:
    - Structure-aware chunking that respects document organization (paragraphs as atomic units)
    - Sliding window chunking for uniform text segmentation
    - Intelligent boundary optimization to avoid breaking semantic units
    - Multi-dimensional quality scoring (coherence, completeness, length, density)
    - Chunk merging capabilities for undersized segments
    - Overlap management for context preservation across chunks. Overlap management is
    defined as including `overlap_size words` from previous chunk start in current chunk. 
    This prevents context loss when processing chunks sequentially. Example: if Chunk 1 ends "...and the results were", Chunk 2 starts with those words + new content

    Attributes:
        max_size (int): Maximum chunk size in words, used as upper boundary
        overlap (int): Configured overlap size (actual = overlap/4)
        min_size (int): Minimum acceptable chunk size for merging operations

        _calculate_semantic_density(content: str) -> float:
            Calculate semantic density based on meaningful word ratio and vocabulary richness.

    Usage Example:
        optimizer = ChunkOptimizer(
            max_size=2048,
            overlap=200,
            min_size=100
        )
        
        # Create optimized chunks from document
        chunks = optimizer.optimize_chunks(document_text, preserve_structure=True)
        
        # Merge small chunks if needed
        final_chunks = optimizer.merge_small_chunks(chunks)
        
        # Access chunk information
        for chunk in final_chunks:
            print(f"Quality Score: {chunk['quality_score']}")
            print(f"Token Count: {chunk['token_count']}")
            print(f"Content: {chunk['content'][:100]}...")

    Notes:
        - The optimizer uses word count as a proxy for token count (tokens ≈ words x 1.3)
        - Quality scores are normalized to 0.0-1.0 range for easy comparison
        - Structure-aware chunking is recommended for documents with clear formatting
        - Sliding window approach works better for continuous prose without clear breaks
        - Overlap content is conservatively calculated as 1/4 of the specified overlap parameter

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Token counting currently uses word splitting which may not match actual LLM tokenization
        - Sentence splitting regex could be enhanced to handle edge cases (abbreviations like "Dr.", decimals like "3.14")
        - Coherence calculation could benefit from more sophisticated NLP techniques
        - No support for handling special document structures (tables, lists, code blocks)
        - Missing validation for input parameters (negative values, overlap > max_size)
        - No async support for processing large documents
        - Could benefit from configurable stop words for different domains
        - No support for custom quality metric weights

        This constructor sets up the fundamental parameters that control how text is divided
        into chunks for LLM processing (text analysis tasks including summarization, 
        question-answering, content generation, and information extraction). The parameters 
        balance between maintaining semantic coherence (through overlap) and respecting LLM 
        context window limitations (maximum tokens processable in single request).

        Args:
        max_size (int, optional): Maximum size of each chunk in words. This parameter
            defines the upper limit for chunk size to ensure compatibility with LLM

            Claude: 100,000+ tokens). Should be set based on the target LLM's token limits,
            accounting for tokens ≈ words × 1.3 for English. Defaults to 2048.
        overlap (int, optional): Number of words to overlap between consecutive chunks.
            This overlap helps maintain context continuity when processing chunks
            sequentially. The actual overlap used is overlap/4 (conservative approach)
            to prevent excessive redundancy. Recommended: overlap ≤ max_size × 0.3.
            Defaults to 200.

            min_size ≥ max_size × 0.1. Defaults to 100.
        logger (logging.Logger, optional): Logger instance for debugging and monitoring
            chunk optimization operations. Used to log warnings about chunk quality,
            size violations, and processing statistics. Defaults to module logger.
        tiktoken (ModuleType, optional): Tokenization library module for accurate
            token counting. Used for converting word counts to token estimates when
            precise token limits are required. Defaults to tiktoken module.
        nltk (ModuleType, optional): Natural Language Toolkit module for advanced
            text processing operations like sentence boundary detection and linguistic
            analysis. Used for improving chunking quality. Defaults to nltk module.

        Attributes Initialized:
        max_size (int): Maximum chunk size in words, used as the upper boundary
            for all chunking operations.
        overlap (int): Configured overlap size, though actual overlap used is
            overlap/4 during processing.
        min_size (int): Minimum chunk size threshold for merging operations.
        logger (logging.Logger): Logger instance for operation monitoring.

        Create chunks that preserve and respect document structure through paragraph boundaries.

    This method implements a structure-aware chunking algorithm that maintains document
    organization by treating paragraphs as atomic units (never split across chunks). It

    limit, then creates a new chunk with appropriate overlap (conservative approach: actual 
    overlap = overlap/4). This approach preserves semantic coherence by avoiding splits 
    within paragraphs and maintaining narrative flow (pronoun references to earlier entities, transition words connecting sentences, consistent temporal sequence, cause-effect relationships.).

            indicated by double newlines (\n\n). The text can be of any length and

        5. Ensures final partial chunk is included if non-empty

    Examples:
        >>> text = '''First paragraph with some content.
        ... 
        ... Second paragraph that continues the narrative.
        ... 
        ... Third paragraph with conclusion.'''

        >>> print(f"Paragraphs per chunk: {[c['paragraph_count'] for c in chunks]}")
        [2, 1]

    Notes:
        - Empty paragraphs (only whitespace) are skipped
        - Overlap is created from the end of previous chunk, not full paragraphs
        - Paragraphs are joined with double newlines in the final content
        - Single very large paragraphs may exceed max_size limits
        - No splitting occurs within paragraphs, maintaining their integrity
        - Better for documents, articles, books with clear formatting

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Handle single paragraphs that exceed max_size by splitting at sentence boundaries (semantic boundaries)
        - Add configuration for paragraph detection (single vs double newlines)
        - Implement smart overlap that prefers complete sentences
        - Add support for preserving markdown headers or section markers
        - Consider weighted paragraph sizing based on content importance
        - Add detection for different paragraph styles (indented, numbered, etc.)
        - Optimize memory usage by using generators for very large texts
        - Add validation for malformed paragraph structures

        """
        Create uniformly-sized chunks using a sliding window approach with configurable overlap.

    This method implements a sliding window chunking algorithm that divides text into
    regular-sized segments without regard for document structure (vs structure-aware approach 
    that preserves paragraph boundaries). It moves through the text with a fixed step size 
    (determined by max_size and overlap), creating chunks of consistent size. This approach 
    is useful for continuous prose without clear breaks or when uniform processing is required.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to be chunked. Will be split into words using
            whitespace as delimiter. Can be any length of continuous text without
            specific structure requirements.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of chunk dictionaries, each containing:
            - 'content' (str): The text content (words joined by spaces)
            - 'token_count' (int): Number of words in the chunk
            - 'paragraph_count' (int): Always 1 (treats chunk as single paragraph)
            - 'sentence_count' (int): Number of sentences detected in chunk
            - 'chunk_type' (str): Always 'sliding_window' for this method
            - 'word_count' (int): Same as token_count
            - 'char_count' (int): Total character count
            - 'paragraphs' (List[str]): Single-element list with chunk content
            - 'start_index' (int): Word index where this chunk begins
            - 'end_index' (int): Word index where this chunk ends (exclusive)

    Algorithm Details:
        - Step size = max(1, max_size - overlap) to ensure forward progress
        - Each chunk contains max_size words (except possibly the last)
        - Chunks overlap by 'overlap' words with the previous chunk (conservative approach:
        actual overlap used = overlap/4 to prevent excessive redundancy)
        - Small final chunks below min_size are included but may be merged later by merge_small_chunks()

    Examples:
        >>> text = "Word " * 1000  # 1000 words
        >>> optimizer = ChunkOptimizer(max_size=100, overlap=20, min_size=50)
        >>> chunks = optimizer._create_sliding_window_chunks(text)
        >>> print(f"Number of chunks: {len(chunks)}")
        >>> print(f"Step size: {100 - 20} = 80 words")
        >>> print(f"Overlap verification: {chunks[1]['start_index'] - chunks[0]['start_index']}")

    Notes:
        - Words are defined as whitespace-separated tokens
        - Preserves original word spacing when reconstructing content
        - Does not break words or apply any text normalization
        - Final chunk may be smaller than max_size if insufficient words remain
        - Overlap is exact except for the final chunk
        - Better for continuous prose, transcripts, streams, technical text

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Add option to handle overlap as percentage of max_size
        - Implement sentence-aware boundaries (semantic boundaries: natural topic breaks) to avoid mid-sentence splits
        - Add support for character-based windowing instead of word-based
        - Consider overlapping with previous chunk's end sentences
        - Add validation for edge cases (overlap >= max_size)
        - Implement dynamic step size based on content density
        - Add option to exclude chunks below min_size
        - Support for custom tokenization beyond whitespace splitting

    standardized format that can be used throughout the chunking pipeline for analysis, scoring, 
    and optimization.

    Args:

        token_count (int): The pre-calculated token/word count for the chunk (tokens ≈ words × 1.3

        paragraphs (List[str]): List of individual paragraphs that comprise this chunk.

        Optimize chunk boundaries to improve coherence and avoid incomplete semantic units.

        This method refines the boundaries of existing chunks through boundary optimization 
        (post-processing to move chunk boundaries from arbitrary positions to natural breaks)
        to ensure they end at natural breaking points such as sentence endings. 
        Boundary optimization is done by:
        - Identify incomplete sentences at chunk end
        - Remove sentences < 5 words
        - Remove sentences without terminal punctuation
        - Ensure chunks end with complete thoughts
        
        It focuses on middle chunks (not first or last) since they are most likely to have 
        arbitrary boundaries from the chunking process. The optimization helps prevent chunks 
        from ending mid-sentence or mid-thought, improving suitability for independent processing.

        Args:
            chunks (List[Dict[str, Any]]): List of chunk dictionaries to optimize. Each chunk
            should contain at least a 'content' field with the text to be optimized.
            Chunks are modified in-place within new dictionaries.
            full_text (str): The complete original text from which chunks were created.
            Currently unused but provided for potential future enhancements such as
            looking ahead to next chunk content or content redistribution.

            - 'word_count': Updated word count after optimization  
            - 'char_count': Updated character count after optimization
            All other fields are preserved from the original chunks.

        Optimization Strategy:
            - First and last chunks are preserved as-is

            - Removes incomplete sentences at chunk ends (< 5 words, no terminal punctuation)

    chunks end with complete thoughts, improving readability and comprehension when chunks
    are processed independently (self-contained for parallel processing), and enhancing
    structural completeness scores.

    Args:
        content (str): The chunk content to optimize. Expected to contain one or more
            sentences that may not end at an ideal boundary due to size-based cutting.

    Optimization Criteria:
        - Removes last sentence if it has fewer than 5 words (hardcoded threshold)
        - Removes last sentence if it doesn't end with terminal punctuation (. ! ? : ; - marks
        that end complete thoughts)

        - Conservative overlap (1/4 reduction factor) prevents excessive redundancy between chunks
        - Prefers semantic boundaries (sentences) over arbitrary word cuts
        - Empty string return prevents prepending meaningless fragments
        - Single sentence overlaps are preferred over partial multi-sentence

        Split text into individual sentences using regex-based pattern matching.

    This method implements sentence boundary detection using regular expressions that
    identify terminal punctuation (. ! ? - marks that end complete thoughts) followed 
    by whitespace. It handles common sentence endings and filters out empty results
    to provide clean sentence segmentation for coherence and completeness calculations.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to split into sentences. Can be a single sentence,
            paragraph, or multi-paragraph text. No preprocessing is required.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of sentences with whitespace trimmed. Empty strings are
            filtered out. Returns empty list if input text contains no valid sentences.
            Each sentence retains its terminal punctuation.

    Regex Pattern:
        - (?<=[.!?])\s+ : Positive lookbehind for terminal punctuation followed by whitespace
        - Splits after ., !, or ? when followed by spaces
        - Preserves the punctuation with the preceding sentence

    Examples:
        >>> text = "First sentence. Second sentence! Is this third? Yes."
        >>> sentences = optimizer._split_sentences(text)
        >>> print(sentences)

        >>> text = "Sentence one.    Sentence two."
        >>> sentences = optimizer._split_sentences(text)

        >>> text = "Incomplete sentence without period"
        >>> sentences = optimizer._split_sentences(text)
        >>> print(sentences)  # ['Incomplete sentence without period']

    Edge Cases (problematic sentence splits):
        - Abbreviations: "Dr. Smith arrived" (false split after "Dr.")
        - Decimals: "The score was 3.14 points" (false split after "3") 
        - Times: "Meeting at 2:30 p.m. today" (false split after "p")
        - URLs: "Visit example.com for details" (false split after "example")

    Notes:
        - Does not handle abbreviations (e.g., "Dr.", "Inc.")
        - May incorrectly split on decimal numbers (e.g., "3.14")
        - Assumes whitespace after punctuation indicates sentence boundary
        - Does not recognize ellipses (...) as sentence boundaries
        - Terminal punctuation inside quotes may cause incorrect splits

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Add abbreviation detection to avoid false splits
        - Handle decimal numbers and times (e.g., "3.14", "2:30 p.m.")
        - Support for ellipses as valid sentence endings
        - Consider quotation mark handling ("He said 'Hello.'")

        """
        Calculate comprehensive quality metrics for a text chunk across multiple dimensions.

    This method evaluates a chunk's quality by computing scores for coherence, completeness,
    length appropriateness, and semantic density. These individual metrics are combined
    using weighted averaging to produce an overall quality score. The metrics help identify
    high-quality chunks suitable for independent LLM processing (comprehensible without 
    other chunks, containing complete thoughts) and those that may need improvement.

    Args:
        chunk (Dict[str, Any]): A chunk dictionary containing at minimum:
            - 'content' (str): The text content to evaluate
            - 'word_count' (int): Pre-calculated word count for efficiency
            Other fields may be present but are not used in metric calculation.

    Returns:
        ChunkMetrics: A dataclass containing:
            - coherence_score (float): Measure of text flow and connectivity (0.0-1.0)
            - completeness_score (float): Measure of sentence/thought completion (0.0-1.0)
            - length_score (float): Measure of size appropriateness (0.0-1.0)
            - semantic_density (float): Measure of meaningful content ratio (0.0-1.0)
            - overall_quality (float): Weighted combination of all metrics (0.0-1.0)

    Metric Weights (data-driven decisions for processing priority):
        - Coherence: 30% - How well sentences flow and connect via transition words
        - Completeness: 25% - Whether thoughts are fully expressed with terminal punctuation
        - Length: 25% - Appropriateness of chunk size relative to optimal length
        - Semantic Density: 20% - Ratio of meaningful words (excluding stop words, ≤2 chars) to total

    Examples:

    Notes:
        - All scores are normalized to 0.0-1.0 using: (raw_score - min_possible) / (max_possible - min_possible)
        - Higher scores indicate better quality
        - Weights are fixed and not configurable
        - Some metrics may be less reliable for very short chunks
        - Quality ≥ 0.7 indicates high-quality chunks suitable for LLM processing

        Calculate coherence score based on linguistic markers of text flow and connectivity.

    This method evaluates how well sentences within a chunk connect and flow together
    by analyzing transition words and pronoun usage. Coherent text typically contains
    explicit connectives (transition words) and referential elements (
        pronouns (he, she, it), demonstratives (this, that, these, those), 
        definite articles with context (the company → previously mentioned company)) 
    that link sentences and maintain topical continuity, supporting narrative flow 
    (logical progression of ideas through consistent temporal sequence and cause-effect relationships).

    Args:
        content (str): The text content to analyze for coherence. Should contain
            multiple sentences for meaningful coherence measurement. Single sentences
            receive a default score of 0.8.

    Returns:
        float: Coherence score between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
            - 1.0 indicates excellent coherence with strong connectives
            - 0.8 is the default for single sentences (assumed coherent)
            - 0.5 indicates moderate coherence
            - 0.0 indicates poor coherence with no connecting elements

    Scoring Components:
        1. Transition Words (60% weight):
        - Counts transitional phrases in sentences after the first
        - Addition: furthermore, moreover, additionally, also
        - Contrast: however, nevertheless, nonetheless, but, yet  
        - Cause/Effect: therefore, consequently, thus, hence
        - Sequence: first, next, finally, meanwhile
        - Score = min(1.0, transition_count / (sentence_count - 1))
        
        2. Pronoun References (40% weight):
        - Counts referential elements that indicate continuity:
        * Pronouns: he, she, it, they (referring to previous entities)
        * Demonstratives: this, that, these, those (pointing to previous content)
        - Expected ratio: 1 pronoun per 20 words
        - Score = min(1.0, pronoun_count / expected_pronouns)

    Examples:
        >>> # High coherence with transitions and pronouns
        >>> text = "John founded the company. However, he faced challenges. Therefore, they pivoted."
        >>> score = optimizer._calculate_coherence(text)

        >>> score = optimizer._calculate_coherence(text)
        >>> print(f"Coherence: {score:.2f}")  # Low score due to no transitions

    Notes:
        - Single sentences receive 0.8 by default (cannot measure flow)
        - Case-insensitive matching for transition words
        - Simple word-boundary checking may miss some transitions
        - Pronoun counting is basic and may include false positives:
            * "It" in "It's raining" (expletive, not referential)
            *  "That" in "That's correct" (demonstrative, not referential)
            * "They" in "They say it's good" (generic, not specific reference)

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Expand transition word list with more sophisticated phrases
        - Add weighted scoring based on transition word strength
        - Implement co-reference resolution (NLP technique identifying when different words 
        refer to same entity. Example: "John founded Apple. He was CEO. The company grew." (John = He, Apple = The company)) for better pronoun tracking

    thoughts/sentences, self-contained for parallel processing) as they contain fully-formed 
    thoughts and proper conclusions.

    Args:
        content (str): The text content to evaluate for completeness. Can be any length
            but requires non-empty content for meaningful scoring. Empty content returns 0.0.

    Returns:

            - 0.5 indicates moderate completeness
            - 0.0 indicates empty or severely incomplete content

    Scoring Components (structural completeness):
        1. Proper Ending (40% weight):
        - Checks if last sentence ends with terminal punctuation (. ! ? : ; - marks 
        that end complete thoughts)
        - Full score (1.0) if properly ended, reduced score (0.7) otherwise
        
        2. Sentence Completeness (40% weight):
        - Ratio of properly ended sentences to total sentences
        - Helps identify chunks with multiple incomplete sentences
        
        3. Multiple Sentences (20% weight):
        - Rewards chunks with multiple sentences (better context)
        - Single sentences receive 0.8, multiple sentences receive 1.0

    def _calculate_semantic_density(self, content: str) -> float:
        """
        Calculate semantic density based on the ratio of meaningful content words to total words.

    This method evaluates the information richness of text by measuring the proportion of
    meaningful words (content words carrying semantic information, excluding stop words and very short words Ex: ) 
    and vocabulary diversity. Higher semantic density indicates more informative content 
    with less filler, making it more valuable for LLM processing and knowledge extraction.

    Args:
        content (str): The text content to analyze. Will be converted to lowercase
            and split on whitespace for word-level analysis. Empty content returns 0.0.

    Returns:
        float: Semantic density score between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
            - 1.0 indicates maximum density (all meaningful words, high uniqueness)
            - 0.7-0.9 typical for informative content
            - 0.5 indicates moderate density with some filler
            - 0.0 indicates empty content or all stop words

    Scoring Components:
        1. Meaningful Word Ratio (70% weight):
        - Excludes stop words: articles (the, a, an), conjunctions (and, or, but), 
        prepositions (in, on, at, to, for, of, with, by), pronouns (I, you, he, she, it),
        auxiliary verbs (is, are, was, were, be, have, do), common modifiers (not, very, too)
        - Excludes words with length ≤ 2 characters
        - Score = meaningful_words / total_words
        
        2. Vocabulary Richness (30% weight):
        - Measures unique meaningful words vs total meaningful words
        - Penalizes repetitive content (vocabulary_richness = unique_words / total_words)
        - Score = unique_meaningful / total_meaningful

    Stop Words List (English function words):
        Articles: the, a, an
        Conjunctions: and, or, but, so, yet, for, nor
        Prepositions: in, on, at, to, for, of, with, by, from, up, about, into, through, during, before, after, above, below, between
        Pronouns: i, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, them, my, your, his, her, its, our, their, mine, yours, ours, theirs, this, that, these, those
        Auxiliary verbs: is, are, was, were, be, been, being, am, have, has, had, having, do, does, did, doing, will, would, shall, should, may, might, can, could, must
        Common modifiers: not, no, yes, very, too, so, just, only, even, also, still

    Examples:
        >>> # High density with meaningful content
        >>> content = "Quantum algorithms revolutionize cryptographic security protocols"
        >>> score = optimizer._calculate_semantic_density(content)
        >>> print(f"Density: {score:.2f}")  # High score, all meaningful words (density ≈ 0.9)
        
        >>> # Low density with many stop words
        >>> content = "The cat is on the mat and it is by the door"
        >>> score = optimizer._calculate_semantic_density(content)
        >>> print(f"Density: {score:.2f}")  # Lower score due to stop words (density ≈ 0.3)
        
        >>> # Repetitive content
        >>> content = "Important important important very very important"
        >>> score = optimizer._calculate_semantic_density(content)
        >>> print(f"Density: {score:.2f}")  # Reduced by uniqueness penalty

    Algorithm:
        meaningful_words = [w for w in words if len(w) > 2 and w not in STOP_WORDS]
        meaningful_ratio = len(meaningful_words) / len(words) if words else 0
        uniqueness_ratio = len(set(meaningful_words)) / len(meaningful_words) if meaningful_words else 0
        semantic_density = (meaningful_ratio * 0.7) + (uniqueness_ratio * 0.3)

    Notes:
        - Case-insensitive stop word matching
        - Simple length-based filtering may exclude valid short words
        - Stop word list is English-specific and hardcoded
        - Does not consider word importance or domain relevance
        - May include false positives in pronoun detection

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Add configurable stop word lists for different domains
        - Support multiple languages with appropriate stop words
        - Consider TF-IDF or similar weighting for word importance
        - Add domain-specific meaningful word detection
        - Handle contractions and hyphenated words properly
        - Consider n-grams for phrase-level density
        - Add support for technical terms and acronyms
        - Implement adaptive stop word detection based on corpus
        - Include part-of-speech tagging for better classification
        - Add semantic similarity clustering for true uniqueness

    def merge_small_chunks(self, chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Merge consecutive chunks that fall below the minimum size threshold.

    This method post-processes (operations after initial chunking) a list of chunks by 
    combining undersized chunks with their neighbors to improve processing efficiency and 
    maintain better context. It iterates through chunks sequentially, merging small chunks 
    with the next chunk if the combined size remains within limits. This helps eliminate 
    fragments while preserving quality and creates candidates for merging (chunks with 
    word_count < min_size, not the last chunk, combined size ≤ max_size, adjacent in order).

    Args:
        chunks (List[Dict[str, Any]]): List of chunk dictionaries to process. Each chunk
            must contain at minimum:
            - 'content' (str): Text content of the chunk
            - 'word_count' (int): Number of words in the chunk
            - 'paragraphs' (List[str]): List of paragraphs in the chunk
            Empty list returns empty list.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: A new list of chunks with small chunks merged. Merged chunks
            contain:
            - Combined content with double newline separation
            - Updated word counts and statistics
            - Concatenated paragraph lists
            - 'chunk_type' set to 'merged'
            - Recalculated quality metrics via _calculate_chunk_metrics()
            - New quality score

    Merging Logic:
        1. Iterate through chunks sequentially
        2. If chunk is too small (word_count < min_size) and not the last:
            - Check if merging with next chunk stays within max_size
            - If yes: merge and skip next chunk in iteration
            - If no: keep original chunk unchanged
        3. Last chunk is never merged (nowhere to merge to)
        4. Quality metrics are recalculated for merged chunks

    Examples:
        >>> chunks = [
        ...     {'content': 'Small chunk', 'word_count': 2, 'paragraphs': ['Small chunk']},
        ...     {'content': 'Another small one', 'word_count': 3, 'paragraphs': ['Another small one']},
        ...     {'content': 'Normal sized chunk with more content', 'word_count': 7, 'paragraphs': ['Normal sized chunk with more content']}
        ... ]
        >>> optimizer = ChunkOptimizer(min_size=5)
        >>> merged = optimizer.merge_small_chunks(chunks)
        >>> print(len(merged))  # Likely 2 instead of 3
        >>> print(merged[0]['chunk_type'])  # 'merged'

    Notes:
        - Only merges adjacent chunks (no look-ahead beyond next)
        - Preserves chunk order in the document
        - May result in chunks exceeding max_size in edge cases
        - Quality scores are recalculated for merged chunks using data-driven decisions
        - Original chunks are not modified (new dictionaries created)

    Areas for Improvement:
        - Implement look-ahead to find best merge candidates
        - Add option to merge backwards (with previous chunk)
        - Consider content similarity when deciding to merge
        - Add configurable merge strategy (greedy, optimal, balanced)
        - Implement three-way merging for very small chunks
        - Add metrics tracking for merge operations
        - Consider preserving original chunk boundaries in metadata
        - Add option to redistribute content between chunks
        - Implement quality threshold to prevent bad merges
        - Add support for non-consecutive chunk merging based on topic
