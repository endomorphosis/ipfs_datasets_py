    Advanced Text Processing and Normalization Utility for Document Pipeline Operations

The TextProcessor class provides comprehensive text processing capabilities
designed for large-scale document processing pipelines, content analysis
workflows, and natural language processing tasks. This utility enables
consistent text normalization, intelligent chunking, and content optimization
for machine learning and information retrieval applications.

language detection, and quality assessment metrics to ensure high-quality
text output for downstream processing. Advanced features include stop word
filtering, punctuation normalization, whitespace optimization, and character
encoding standardization.

Core Processing Features:
- Comprehensive text cleaning with configurable normalization rules
- Intelligent sentence segmentation with context-aware boundary detection
- Advanced whitespace normalization and character encoding standardization
- Stop word filtering with customizable vocabulary and language support
- Punctuation normalization including quote standardization and symbol cleanup
- Content quality assessment with readability and coherence metrics
- Language detection and processing optimization for multilingual content

Text Normalization Capabilities:
- Unicode normalization with consistent character representation
- HTML entity decoding and markup removal for web content
- Quote character standardization across different typography systems
- Whitespace consolidation and line break normalization
- Special character filtering with preservation of meaningful punctuation
- Case normalization with context-sensitive capitalization handling

Sentence Processing:
- Context-aware sentence boundary detection with abbreviation handling
- Segment filtering based on length, quality, and content characteristics
- Sentence-level metadata extraction including structure and complexity
- Multi-paragraph processing with document structure preservation
- Citation and reference extraction for academic and technical documents

Content Quality Assessment:
- Text coherence analysis with logical flow evaluation
- Readability metrics including complexity and accessibility scores
- Content density analysis for information extraction optimization
- Language quality assessment with grammar and syntax validation
- Duplicate content detection and similarity analysis

Attributes:
    stop_words (Set[str]): Comprehensive collection of common stop words
        for English language processing, including articles, prepositions,
        conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs. Used for content filtering and
        relevance analysis in information retrieval applications.

        Comprehensive text quality assessment and metrics

Usage Examples:
    # Initialize text processor
    processor = TextProcessor()
    
    # Clean and normalize raw text
    raw_text = "  This is a sample text...  with irregular   spacing!  "
    clean_text = processor.clean_text(raw_text)
    print(f"Cleaned: {clean_text}")
    
    # Split text into sentences
    document_text = "First sentence. Second sentence! Third sentence?"
    sentences = processor.split_sentences(document_text)
    for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        print(f"Sentence {i+1}: {sentence}")
    
    # Extract keywords for content analysis
    content = "Machine learning and artificial intelligence..."
    keywords = processor.extract_keywords(content, max_keywords=5)
    print(f"Keywords: {keywords}")
    
    # Assess text quality for filtering
    quality_metrics = processor.assess_quality(content)
    if quality_metrics['coherence_score'] > 0.7:
        print("High-quality content suitable for processing")

Dependencies:
    Required:
    - re: Regular expression operations for pattern matching and text cleaning
    - logging: Structured logging for processing status and error reporting
    - typing: Type annotations for improved code reliability and documentation
    - collections: Counter utility for frequency analysis and keyword extraction
    
    Optional:
    - nltk: Advanced natural language processing capabilities
    - langdetect: Language detection for multilingual content processing
    - textstat: Readability and complexity metrics calculation

Notes:
    - Text processing operations are optimized for large-scale document pipelines
    - Stop word lists can be customized for domain-specific applications
    - Quality assessment metrics help filter low-quality content automatically
    - Sentence segmentation handles edge cases including abbreviations and citations
    - Memory usage is optimized for processing large documents and corpora
    - Unicode normalization ensures consistent text representation across systems
    - Language detection enables multilingual processing with appropriate models
    - Processing speed scales linearly with text length for predictable performance

    Initialize Text Processing Utility with Comprehensive Language Resources

Establishes a new TextProcessor instance with comprehensive text processing
capabilities including stop word vocabularies, normalization rules, and
quality assessment parameters. This initialization prepares all necessary
language resources and processing configurations for high-performance
text processing operations.

The initialization process configures stop word collections, regular
expression patterns, normalization rules, and quality metrics required
for consistent text processing across different content types and
domains. Default configurations provide robust processing for English
language content with extensibility for multilingual applications.

Attributes Initialized:
    stop_words (Set[str]): Comprehensive English stop word collection
        including common articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and
        auxiliary verbs. This vocabulary is used for content filtering,
        keyword extraction, and relevance analysis. The collection includes:
        
        - Articles: 'the', 'a', 'an'
        - Prepositions: 'in', 'on', 'at', 'to', 'for', 'of', 'with', 'by'
        - Conjunctions: 'and', 'or', 'but'
        - Pronouns: 'this', 'that', 'these', 'those'
        - Auxiliary verbs: 'is', 'are', 'was', 'were', 'be', 'been', 'being'
        - Modal verbs: 'have', 'has', 'had', 'do', 'does', 'did'
        - Future/conditional: 'will', 'would', 'could', 'should'
        
        The stop word list can be extended or customized for domain-specific
        applications requiring specialized vocabulary filtering.

Examples:
    # Basic initialization for general text processing
    processor = TextProcessor()
    
    # The processor is now ready for text operations
    cleaned_text = processor.clean_text("Sample text with   irregular spacing!")
    sentences = processor.split_sentences(cleaned_text)

Notes:
    - Stop word collection optimized for English language content
    - Default configuration provides robust processing for most applications
    - Stop word vocabulary can be extended for specialized domains
    - Processing patterns are initialized for optimal performance
    - Memory footprint is minimized while maintaining comprehensive functionality
    - Thread-safe initialization enables concurrent processing operations
