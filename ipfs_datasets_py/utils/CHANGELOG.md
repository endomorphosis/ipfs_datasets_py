## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-04

### Added - Initial Implementation

#### Text Processing Module (`text_processing.py`)
- **TextProcessor class**: Comprehensive text processing and normalization utility
  - **clean_text()**: Text cleaning with whitespace normalization, special character filtering, quote standardization
  - **split_sentences()**: Intelligent sentence segmentation with quality filtering (minimum 10 characters)
  - **split_paragraphs()**: Paragraph splitting on double newlines with length filtering (minimum 20 characters)
  - **extract_keywords()**: Frequency-based keyword extraction with stop word filtering (top 20 configurable)
  - **extract_phrases()**: N-gram phrase extraction with configurable length (2-4 words default)
  - **calculate_readability_score()**: Readability assessment based on sentence/word length metrics
  - **Comprehensive stop words**: English stop word collection including articles, prepositions, conjunctions

#### Chunk Optimization Module (`chunk_optimizer.py`)
- **ChunkOptimizer class**: Advanced text chunking with quality metrics
  - **optimize_chunks()**: Main optimization method with structure-aware and sliding window modes
  - **merge_small_chunks()**: Intelligent merging of undersized chunks
  - **Quality metrics system**: ChunkMetrics dataclass with coherence, completeness, length, semantic density scores
  - **Structure-aware chunking**: Respects paragraph boundaries and document structure
  - **Sliding window chunking**: Overlapping chunks for continuous content processing
  - **Boundary optimization**: Sentence-aware chunk boundary adjustment
  - **Content quality assessment**: Multi-factor scoring system for chunk evaluation

### Technical Features

#### Text Processing Capabilities
- **Unicode normalization**: Consistent character representation across systems
- **Sentence boundary detection**: Context-aware segmentation with abbreviation handling
- **Keyword extraction**: TF-based ranking with stop word filtering
- **Phrase extraction**: Configurable n-gram analysis for key phrase identification
- **Quality assessment**: Readability scoring for content filtering

#### Chunk Optimization Features
- **Adaptive chunking**: Multiple strategies (structure-aware, sliding window)
- **Quality scoring**: Multi-dimensional quality assessment
  - Coherence: Transition word analysis and pronoun reference detection
  - Completeness: Sentence ending validation and structure assessment
  - Length optimization: Ideal size range targeting with scoring
  - Semantic density: Meaningful content ratio calculation
- **Boundary optimization**: Sentence and paragraph-aware chunk endings
- **Content overlap**: Intelligent overlap for context preservation
- **Merge optimization**: Automatic merging of undersized chunks

### Configuration Options
- **TextProcessor**: No configuration required (uses built-in stop words)
- **ChunkOptimizer**: 
  - max_size: Maximum chunk size in tokens (default: 2048)
  - overlap: Overlap size for sliding window (default: 200)
  - min_size: Minimum acceptable chunk size (default: 100)

### Documentation Enhancement
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: Enterprise-grade documentation following project standards
- **Usage examples**: Detailed examples for all major methods
- **Type annotations**: Full type hint coverage for all public APIs
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation

### Worker Assignments
