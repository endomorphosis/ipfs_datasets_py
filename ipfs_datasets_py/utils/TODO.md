# TODO List for utils/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 61**: Complete TDD tasks for utils/ directory

## Documentation Enhancement Update (Worker 177) - 2025-07-04
**Status**: COMPREHENSIVE DOCSTRINGS COMPLETED FOR TEXT PROCESSING
**Issue**: TextProcessor class lacked comprehensive documentation following project standards
**Resolution**: Enhanced all public classes and methods with enterprise-grade docstrings

### Completed by Worker 177
- Enhanced TextProcessor class with comprehensive documentation following _example_docstring_format.md
- Added detailed __init__ method documentation with stop word vocabulary explanation
- Improved documentation covers text normalization, sentence processing, quality assessment
- Added extensive usage examples and dependency documentation
- All public methods now have detailed Args, Returns, Raises, Examples, and Notes sections

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-02
**Status**: UTILS DIRECTORY FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for TextProcessor and ChunkOptimizer classes that are already fully implemented
**Resolution**: The utils directory contains comprehensive implementations with all major methods complete

## Current State Summary
- text_processing.py contains two fully implemented classes:
  - TextProcessor: clean_text, split_sentences, split_paragraphs, extract_keywords, extract_phrases, calculate_readability_score
  - ChunkOptimizer: create_chunks, optimize_chunk_boundaries, analyze_chunk_quality, and various helper methods
- All methods are implemented with comprehensive functionality
- Directory has robust implementation with proper error handling and text processing capabilities
- Worker 61 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
