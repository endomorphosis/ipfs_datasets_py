# TODO List for llm/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 68**: Complete TDD tasks for llm/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: LLM DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The llm directory contains comprehensive LLM interface and reasoning tracer implementations

## Current State Summary
- llm_reasoning_tracer.py contains multiple implemented classes:
  - ReasoningNodeType (enum), ReasoningNode, ReasoningEdge, ReasoningTrace (dataclasses)
  - LLMReasoningTracer (comprehensive implementation)
  - WikipediaKnowledgeGraphTracer (comprehensive implementation)
- llm_interface.py contains LLMConfig, LLMInterface, and PromptTemplate classes
- llm_semantic_validation.py contains semantic validation functionality
- llm_graphrag.py contains GraphRAG LLM integration
- Directory has working LLM interfaces and reasoning systems
- Worker 68 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - LLM Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] llm/llm_reasoning_tracer.py
    - [x] ReasoningNodeType (enum)

- [x] llm/llm_semantic_validation.py (semantic validation functionality)
- [x] llm/llm_graphrag.py (GraphRAG LLM integration)

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 68
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for LLMReasoningTracer class
- [ ] Add tests for WikipediaKnowledgeGraphTracer class
- [ ] Add tests for ReasoningNode, ReasoningEdge, and ReasoningTrace dataclasses
- [ ] Add tests for LLMInterface and LLMConfig classes
- [ ] Add tests for PromptTemplate class
- [ ] Create integration tests for LLM reasoning workflows
- [ ] Add tests for semantic validation functionality
- [ ] Test GraphRAG LLM integration

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
