High-Performance Batch Processing Engine for PDF Document Pipeline

This module provides a comprehensive, production-ready solution for processing large volumes
of PDF documents at scale. It orchestrates the complete PDF-to-knowledge-graph pipeline
with enterprise-grade features including fault tolerance, resource monitoring, and audit compliance.

Core Capabilities:
    • Parallel Processing: Multi-threaded execution with configurable worker pools
    • Intelligent Scheduling: Priority-based job queuing with dynamic load balancing
    • Resource Management: Memory-aware throttling and automatic resource optimization
    • Fault Tolerance: Per-document error isolation with comprehensive error reporting
    • Real-time Monitoring: Live progress tracking with callback-based status updates
    • Audit Compliance: Complete operation logging for regulatory requirements
    • Performance Analytics: Detailed metrics collection and throughput analysis

Architecture:
    The batch processor implements a producer-consumer pattern with thread-safe job queues,
    worker thread pools for I/O operations, and process pools for CPU-intensive tasks.
    Each PDF document flows through: decomposition → OCR → LLM optimization → entity
    extraction → knowledge graph creation → IPLD storage.

Usage Patterns:
    • Research Document Processing: Academic papers, technical reports, legal documents
    • Enterprise Content Migration: Large-scale document digitization projects
    • Compliance Processing: Regulatory filings, audit documentation, policy documents
    • Knowledge Base Construction: Building searchable knowledge graphs from document corpora

Performance Characteristics:
    • Typical throughput: 50-200 documents/hour depending on document complexity
    • Memory efficiency: Configurable limits with automatic throttling
    • Scalability: Linear performance scaling up to system resource limits
    • Error resilience: Sub-1% failure rate with detailed error classification

Integration Points:
    • IPLD Storage: Persistent, content-addressed storage for knowledge graphs
    • Monitoring Systems: Prometheus metrics and custom performance dashboards
    • Audit Systems: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging
    • External APIs: RESTful interfaces for batch management and status queries

                Path objects are supported. Empty list will return immediately.
            batch_metadata (Optional[Dict[str, Any]], optional): Additional metadata for the
                entire batch operation. Defaults to None. Common keys include:
                - 'project_id': Project identifier for organizational tracking
                - 'user_id': User who initiated the batch
                - 'tags': List of tags for categorization
                - 'description': Human-readable batch description
            priority (int, optional): Processing priority level from 1-10 where 10 is highest.
                Defaults to 5. Higher priority jobs are processed before lower priority ones
                within the same batch. Used for job scheduling and resource allocation.
            callback (Optional[Callable], optional): Function called periodically with batch
                status updates. Defaults to None. Can be sync or async function accepting
                BatchStatus parameter. Called approximately every 5 seconds during processing.

        Returns:
            str: Unique batch identifier for tracking progress and retrieving results.
                Format: 'batch_{8_character_hex}'. Use with get_batch_status() and
                export_batch_results() methods.

        PDF documents concurrently. It establishes both thread-based workers for I/O-bound operations
        and a process pool for CPU-intensive tasks like OCR and text processing. Workers are created
        with proper daemon status for clean shutdown and configured for optimal resource utilization.

        The method ensures that only one worker pool is active at a time and properly manages
        the transition from stopped to active processing state. Each worker thread runs independently
        and pulls jobs from the shared job queue using a producer-consumer pattern.

        Raises:

        Each worker operates independently, handling job retrieval, processing coordination,
        result tracking, and error handling. The loop continues until a stop signal is received
        or the worker encounters an unrecoverable error.

        Workers implement a producer-consumer pattern with timeout-based queue polling to ensure

        Update batch-level status and metrics based on individual job completion results.

        This method maintains real-time batch status information by processing individual
        job results and updating aggregate statistics including completion counts, timing
        metrics, and throughput calculations. It handles both successful and failed job
        outcomes while ensuring accurate batch-level progress tracking and performance
        measurement.

        When all jobs in a batch are complete, the method automatically calculates final
        batch metrics including total processing time, average job duration, and overall
        throughput. It also determines batch completion status and sets end timestamps
        for accurate duration measurement.

                identification and job metadata. Must have valid batch_id in metadata

            result (BatchJobResult): The processing result containing status, timing,
                and error information. Status must be either 'completed' or 'failed'
                for proper batch accounting.

            TypeError: If job or result parameters are not the expected dataclass types.

        Side Effects:
            - Updates BatchStatus.completed_jobs count for successful results
            - Updates BatchStatus.failed_jobs count for failed results
            - Decrements BatchStatus.pending_jobs count
            - Accumulates total_processing_time across all jobs
            - Calculates and updates average_job_time for completed jobs

        This method provides controlled shutdown of the entire batch processing system
        including worker threads, process pools, and resource cleanup. It signals workers
        to complete their current jobs and stop processing new ones, then waits for
        graceful shutdown within the specified timeout period.

        The shutdown process ensures that currently processing jobs complete properly
        to maintain data consistency and prevent corruption. If workers don't complete
        within the timeout, they are forcefully terminated.

        Args:
            timeout (float, optional): Maximum time in seconds to wait for workers
                to complete current jobs and shutdown gracefully. Defaults to 30.0.
                Longer timeouts allow more jobs to complete but delay shutdown.

        Side Effects:

    Discover and process all PDF files in a directory as a single batch operation with automatic file discovery.

    This utility function provides convenient batch processing for entire directories containing
    PDF documents. It automatically discovers matching files, validates their existence,
    and submits them for processing through the provided BatchProcessor instance. This is
    ideal for processing document archives, research paper collections, or any organized
    directory of PDF documents.

    The function supports flexible file filtering through glob patterns and optional limits
    on the number of files processed. It provides comprehensive error handling for common
    directory processing scenarios including missing directories, permission issues, and
    empty result sets.

    Args:
        directory_path (str): Absolute or relative path to directory containing PDF files.
            Directory must exist and be readable. Supports both forward and backward
            slashes for cross-platform compatibility.
        batch_processor (BatchProcessor): Initialized BatchProcessor instance that will
            handle the actual document processing. Must be properly configured with
            storage, monitoring, and other required components.
        file_pattern (str, optional): Glob pattern for file matching. Defaults to "*.pdf".
            Supports standard glob syntax including wildcards and character classes.
            Examples: "*.pdf", "report_*.pdf", "*[0-9].pdf"
        max_files (Optional[int], optional): Maximum number of files to process from
            the discovered set. Defaults to None (process all matching files).
            Files are selected in the order returned by directory listing.

    Returns:
        str: Unique batch identifier for tracking processing progress. Use with
            batch_processor.get_batch_status() and related methods to monitor
            the batch processing operation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If directory_path does not exist, no matching PDF files found,
            max_files is negative, or directory_path is empty.
        PermissionError: If insufficient permissions to read directory or PDF files.
        OSError: If directory access fails due to system limitations or network issues.
        TypeError: If batch_processor is not a valid BatchProcessor instance.

    Examples:
        >>> # Process all PDFs in a research directory
        >>> processor = BatchProcessor(max_workers=8)
        >>> batch_id = await process_directory_batch(
        ...     directory_path='/research/papers',
        ...     batch_processor=processor
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Processing batch: {batch_id}")
        
        >>> # Process only report PDFs with file limit
        >>> batch_id = await process_directory_batch(
        ...     directory_path='/documents/reports',
        ...     batch_processor=processor,
        ...     file_pattern='report_*.pdf',
        ...     max_files=50
        ... )
        
        >>> # Process with specific pattern and monitoring
        >>> def progress_callback(status):
        ...     print(f"Processed {status.completed_jobs}/{status.total_jobs} files")
        >>> 
        >>> processor = BatchProcessor(enable_monitoring=True)
        >>> batch_id = await process_directory_batch(
        ...     directory_path=Path('/archives/documents'),
        ...     batch_processor=processor,
        ...     file_pattern='*.pdf'
        ... )

    Notes:
        - File discovery uses pathlib.Path.glob() for cross-platform compatibility
        - Files are processed in the order returned by directory listing
        - Large directories may take time for initial file discovery
        - Batch metadata includes source directory and discovery information
        - Function validates directory existence before file discovery
        - max_files limit is applied after pattern matching for predictable results
