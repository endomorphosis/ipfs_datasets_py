class OCREngine(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class defining the interface for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines.

    The OCREngine class serves as the foundation for all OCR engine implementations within
    the PDF processing pipeline, providing a standardized interface for text extraction
    from image data. It establishes the contract that all concrete OCR implementations
    must follow, enabling interchangeable OCR backends and consistent behavior across
    different OCR technologies.

    This abstract base class ensures that all OCR engines implement essential methods
    for initialization, availability checking, and text extraction while allowing
    each implementation to optimize for specific use cases, document types, or
    performance characteristics.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Human-readable identifier for the OCR engine (e.g., 'tesseract', 'surya').
        available (bool): Flag indicating whether the OCR engine is properly initialized
            and available for use. Set to True after successful initialization.

    Abstract Methods:
        _initialize(): Perform engine-specific initialization including model loading,
            dependency checking, and configuration setup.
        extract_text(image_data: bytes) -> Dict[str, Any]: Extract text content from
            image data bytes and return structured results with text, confidence scores,
            and metadata.

    Public Methods:
        is_available() -> bool: Check if the OCR engine is available and ready for use.

    Usage Example:
        # Concrete implementation example
        class CustomOCR(OCREngine):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__("custom_ocr")
            
            def _initialize(self):
                # Initialize custom OCR components

                # Implement text extraction logic
                return {"text": extracted_text, "confidence": 0.95}

    Notes:
        - All concrete implementations must call super().__init__(name) in their constructor
        - The _initialize() method should set self.available = True upon successful setup
        - The available flag is used by the MultiEngineOCR to determine engine viability
        - Exception handling during initialization should set available = False
        - Text extraction results should follow a consistent dictionary format
    """

        Initialize an OCR engine instance with comprehensive setup and validation.

        This constructor establishes the foundation for all OCR engine implementations by
        setting up the engine name, initializing availability status, and performing
        engine-specific initialization through the abstract _initialize() method. The
        initialization process includes dependency checking, model loading, and error
        handling to ensure the engine is ready for text extraction operations.

        The constructor implements a robust initialization pattern where engines are
        marked as unavailable by default and only set to available after successful
        completion of all initialization steps. This ensures that only fully functional
        engines are used for OCR processing.

        Args:
            name (str): Unique identifier for the OCR engine (e.g., 'tesseract', 'surya',
            'easyocr', 'trocr'). Must be a non-empty string that clearly identifies
            the underlying OCR technology. This name is used for logging, debugging,
            and engine selection in multi-engine scenarios.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If name is None or not a string type. This ensures type safety
            and prevents runtime errors during engine identification and logging.

        Attributes Set:
            name (str): The engine identifier passed during initialization
            available (bool): Set to False initially, updated to True only after
            successful initialization via _initialize()

        Initialization Flow:
            1. Validate name parameter type and value
            2. Set engine name and mark as unavailable
            3. Call abstract _initialize() method for engine-specific setup
            4. Handle initialization exceptions gracefully with logging
            5. Preserve availability status based on initialization outcome

    """
    Transformer-based OCR engine specialized for handwritten and printed text recognition.

    TrOCREngine implements Microsoft's TrOCR (Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition)
    approach, which leverages the power of transformer architectures for high-quality text
    recognition. This engine is particularly effective for handwritten text, printed text,
    and scenarios where traditional OCR engines face challenges with font variations or
    document quality issues.

    TrOCR represents a significant advancement in OCR technology by applying transformer
    models (similar to those used in language models) to the visual recognition task,
    resulting in improved accuracy and better handling of diverse text styles and qualities.

    Key Features:
    - Transformer-based architecture for superior text recognition
    - Specialized performance on handwritten text
    - Excellent handling of diverse fonts and text styles
    - Robust performance on low-quality or degraded documents
    - End-to-end learning approach without separate detection/recognition stages
    - Pre-trained models optimized for various text types

    Attributes:
        processor: TrOCR processor for image preprocessing and text postprocessing
        model: Loaded TrOCR Vision-Encoder-Decoder model for text recognition

    Dependencies:
        - transformers: Hugging Face Transformers library for TrOCR models
        - torch: PyTorch framework for neural network operations
        - PIL: Python Imaging Library for image format handling

    Model Variants:
        - microsoft/trocr-base-printed: Optimized for printed text recognition
        - microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten: Specialized for handwritten text
        - microsoft/trocr-large-*: Higher capacity models for improved accuracy

    Processing Pipeline:
        1. Convert image data to PIL Image and ensure RGB format
        2. Preprocess image using TrOCR processor (tokenization, normalization)
        3. Generate text using Vision-Encoder-Decoder transformer model
        4. Decode generated tokens to text using TrOCR processor
        5. Return structured results with generated text

        Extract text from image data using multiple OCR engines with intelligent retry strategies.

        This method orchestrates text extraction across multiple OCR engines using configurable
        processing strategies and quality thresholds. It automatically retries with different
        engines until the confidence threshold is met or all available engines are exhausted,
        ensuring optimal text extraction quality and reliability.

        The method implements intelligent engine selection based on document characteristics,
        confidence scoring, and processing strategy preferences. It provides comprehensive
        error handling and falls back gracefully when engines fail, returning the best
        available result even if no engine meets the specified confidence threshold.

        Args:
            image_data (bytes): Raw image data in any PIL-supported format (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.).
            Must be non-empty bytes containing valid image content. Higher resolution images
            typically provide better OCR accuracy across all engines.
            
            strategy (str, optional): Processing strategy determining engine priority order.
            Defaults to 'quality_first'. Available strategies:
            - 'quality_first': Prioritizes accuracy (Surya → Tesseract → EasyOCR → TrOCR)
            - 'speed_first': Prioritizes processing speed (Tesseract → Surya → EasyOCR → TrOCR)  
            - 'accuracy_first': Prioritizes maximum accuracy (Surya → EasyOCR → TrOCR → Tesseract)
            
            confidence_threshold (float, optional): Minimum confidence score (0.0-1.0) required
            to accept OCR results without trying additional engines. Defaults to 0.8.
            Higher thresholds improve quality but may require more processing attempts.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: Comprehensive extraction results containing:
            - 'text' (str): Extracted text content with formatting preserved
            - 'confidence' (float): Confidence score (0.0-1.0) from the successful engine
            - 'engine' (str): Name of the OCR engine that produced the result
            - 'error' (str, optional): Error message if all engines failed
            - Additional engine-specific metadata may include:
              - 'text_blocks': Spatial text information with bounding boxes
              - 'word_boxes': Word-level confidence and position data

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: If no OCR engines are available for processing
            TypeError: If image_data is not bytes or confidence_threshold is not float

            MemoryError: If image is too large for available system memory
            OSError: If image data is corrupted or in an unsupported format

            ...     confidence_threshold=0.95
            ... )

        Processing Flow:
            1. Validate input parameters and engine availability
            2. Select engine priority order based on processing strategy
            3. Filter to only available engines in the current environment
            4. Iterate through engines in priority order:
               - Attempt text extraction with current engine
               - Evaluate confidence score against threshold
               - Return result if threshold is met
               - Continue to next engine if threshold not met or engine fails
            5. Return best available result if no engine meets threshold
            6. Return error result if all engines fail

        Notes:
            - Processing stops as soon as confidence threshold is achieved
            - All engine failures are logged but don't prevent trying other engines
            - Results are ranked by confidence score to return the best available outcome
            - Engine selection can be influenced by document type classification
            - Memory usage scales with number of engines and image size
            - Thread-safe for concurrent processing operations
