    """
    Extract potential entity names from query text using NLTK NER and POS tagging.

    This method identifies likely entity names within query text using proper
    Natural Language Processing techniques including Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging from NLTK. It combines NER results with
    proper noun detection to identify person names, organization names, locations,
    and other named entities.

    Args:
        query (str): Query string that may contain entity names.
            Can be normalized or raw query text. 
        min_chars (int): Minimum character length for valid entity names.
            Defaults to 0 characters to filter capture abbreviations (e.g. CA, NY).

    Returns:
        List[str]: List of potential entity names extracted from the query.
            Each name is a complete entity as identified by NER.
            Returns empty list if no entities are found.
            Names are returned in order of appearance in the query.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If query is not a string.
        ValueError: If query is empty or contains only whitespace.
        ImportError: If NLTK is not available.
        RuntimeError: If NLTK data cannot be downloaded or loaded.

    Examples:
        >>> _extract_entity_names_from_query("Who is Bill Gates?")
        ['Bill Gates']
        >>> _extract_entity_names_from_query("Microsoft and Apple are competitors")
        ['Microsoft', 'Apple']
        >>> _extract_entity_names_from_query("path from John Smith to Mary Johnson")
        ['John Smith', 'Mary Johnson']
        >>> _extract_entity_names_from_query("what is artificial intelligence")
        []

    Notes:
        - Uses NLTK's named entity recognition for accurate entity detection
        - Filters out common question words and stop words
        - Combines NER results with proper noun detection for comprehensive coverage
        - Handles punctuation and various text formats appropriately
        - Works with properly formatted natural language queries

        Integrate an LLM-optimized document into the GraphRAG system.

        This method performs end-to-end integration of a processed document into the GraphRAG
        knowledge graph system. It extracts entities and relationships from document chunks,
        creates a comprehensive knowledge graph, stores it in IPLD for distributed access,
        and merges it with the global knowledge graph to enable cross-document reasoning.

                                       embeddings, and metadata from LLM processing pipeline.
                                       Must include document_id, title, and processed chunks.
