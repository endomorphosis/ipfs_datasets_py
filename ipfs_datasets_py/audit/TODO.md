# TODO List for audit/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 70**: Complete TDD tasks for audit/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-02
**Status**: AUDIT DIRECTORY LARGELY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for SecurityProvenanceIntegrator class that is already fully implemented
**Resolution**: The audit directory contains a comprehensive SecurityProvenanceIntegrator class with all major methods implemented

## Current State Summary
- security_provenance_integration.py contains a fully implemented SecurityProvenanceIntegrator class
- All methods are already implemented (see below for specific methods)
- Directory has comprehensive implementation with proper error handling and security integration
- Worker 70 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code
