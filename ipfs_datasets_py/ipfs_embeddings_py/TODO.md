# TODO List for ipfs_embeddings_py/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 72**: Complete TDD tasks for ipfs_embeddings_py/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: IPFS_EMBEDDINGS_PY DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The ipfs_embeddings_py directory contains comprehensive IPFS embeddings implementations

## Current State Summary
- embeddings_engine.py contains EmbeddingConfig, ChunkingConfig (dataclasses), and AdvancedIPFSEmbeddings classes
- multi_model_embedding.py contains MultiModelEmbeddingGenerator class (comprehensive implementation)
- ipfs_embeddings.py contains ipfs_embeddings_py class
- ipfs_multiformats.py contains ipfs_multiformats_py class
- ipfs_only_hash.py contains ipfs_only_hash_py class
- test/ subdirectory contains test implementations
- Directory has working IPFS embeddings generation and multi-model support
- Worker 72 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - IPFS Embeddings Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] ipfs_embeddings_py/embeddings_engine.py
    - [x] EmbeddingConfig (dataclass)
    - [x] ChunkingConfig (dataclass)
    - [x] AdvancedIPFSEmbeddings (comprehensive implementation)

- [x] ipfs_embeddings_py/multi_model_embedding.py

    - [x] ipfs_multiformats_py

- [x] ipfs_embeddings_py/ipfs_only_hash.py
    - [x] ipfs_only_hash_py

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 72
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for AdvancedIPFSEmbeddings class
- [ ] Add tests for MultiModelEmbeddingGenerator class
- [ ] Add tests for EmbeddingConfig and ChunkingConfig dataclasses
- [ ] Add tests for ipfs_embeddings_py class
- [ ] Add tests for ipfs_multiformats_py class
- [ ] Add tests for ipfs_only_hash_py class
- [ ] Create integration tests for IPFS embeddings workflows
- [ ] Enhance existing tests in test/ subdirectory

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
