# TODO List for embeddings/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 66**: Complete TDD tasks for embeddings/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-02
**Status**: EMBEDDINGS DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The embeddings directory contains comprehensive implementations across multiple files

## Current State Summary
- schema.py contains BaseComponent class with __init_subclass__ and class_name methods
- create_embeddings.py contains embedding creation functionality
- core.py contains core embedding operations
- chunker.py contains text chunking functionality
- Directory has working implementations with proper schema definitions
- Worker 66 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - Embeddings Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] embeddings/schema.py
    - [x] BaseComponent
        - [x] __init_subclass__
        - [x] class_name

- [x] embeddings/create_embeddings.py (embedding creation functionality)
- [x] embeddings/core.py (core embedding operations)  
- [x] embeddings/chunker.py (text chunking functionality)

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 66
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for BaseComponent class
- [ ] Add tests for embedding creation functionality
- [ ] Add tests for core embedding operations
- [ ] Add tests for chunker functionality
- [ ] Create integration tests between different embedding components
- [ ] Add performance tests and edge case handling

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
