# TODO List for ipld/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 62**: Complete TDD tasks for ipld/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: IPLD DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The ipld directory contains comprehensive IPLD implementations across multiple files

## Current State Summary
- vector_store.py contains SearchResult dataclass and IPLDVectorStore class (comprehensive implementation)
- storage.py contains CID class, IPLDSchema class, and IPLDStorage class
- dag_pb.py contains CID class, PBLink class, and PBNode class
- optimized_codec.py contains IPLD codec implementations
- knowledge_graph.py contains knowledge graph functionality
- Directory has working IPLD storage and vector store implementations
- Worker 62 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - IPLD Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] ipld/vector_store.py
    - [x] SearchResult (dataclass)
    - [x] IPLDVectorStore (comprehensive implementation with vector operations)

- [x] ipld/storage.py
    - [x] CID
    - [x] IPLDSchema
    - [x] IPLDStorage

- [x] ipld/dag_pb.py
    - [x] CID
    - [x] PBLink
    - [x] PBNode

- [x] ipld/optimized_codec.py (codec implementations)
- [x] ipld/knowledge_graph.py (knowledge graph functionality)

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 62
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for IPLDVectorStore class
- [ ] Add tests for SearchResult dataclass
- [ ] Add tests for IPLDStorage and IPLDSchema classes
- [ ] Add tests for PBLink and PBNode classes
- [ ] Create integration tests for IPLD storage operations
- [ ] Add performance tests for vector storage and retrieval
- [ ] Test knowledge graph functionality

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
