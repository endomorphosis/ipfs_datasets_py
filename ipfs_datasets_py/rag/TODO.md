# TODO List for rag/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 64**: Complete TDD tasks for rag/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-02
**Status**: RAG DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The rag directory contains comprehensive RAG query optimization and dashboard implementations

## Current State Summary
- rag_query_optimizer.py contains GraphRAGQueryOptimizer implementation
- rag_query_optimizer_minimal.py contains GraphRAGQueryStats and GraphRAGQueryOptimizer classes
- rag_dashboard_enhancement.py contains dashboard enhancement functionality
- rag_query_dashboard.py contains dashboard implementation
- rag_query_visualization.py contains visualization components
- Directory has working RAG optimization and dashboard systems
- Worker 64 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - RAG Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] rag/rag_query_optimizer_minimal.py
    - [x] GraphRAGQueryStats
    - [x] GraphRAGQueryOptimizer

- [x] rag/rag_query_optimizer.py (GraphRAGQueryOptimizer implementation)
- [x] rag/rag_dashboard_enhancement.py (dashboard enhancement functionality)
- [x] rag/rag_query_dashboard.py (dashboard implementation)
- [x] rag/rag_query_visualization.py (visualization components)

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 64
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for GraphRAGQueryOptimizer
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for GraphRAGQueryStats
- [ ] Add tests for dashboard components
- [ ] Create integration tests between RAG optimization and visualization components
- [ ] Test performance of RAG query optimization algorithms
- [ ] Add end-to-end RAG workflow tests

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
