# TODO List for multimedia/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 69**: Complete TDD tasks for multimedia/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: MULTIMEDIA DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The multimedia directory contains comprehensive media processing and wrapper implementations

## Current State Summary
- media_processor.py contains MediaProcessor class (comprehensive implementation)
- media_utils.py contains MediaUtils class with various utility methods
- ffmpeg_wrapper.py contains FFmpegWrapper class with async support
- ytdlp_wrapper.py contains YtDlpWrapper class with async support and enhanced features
- Directory has working media processing, FFmpeg integration, and YouTube-dl functionality
- Worker 69 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - Multimedia Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] multimedia/media_processor.py
    - [x] MediaProcessor (comprehensive implementation)

- [x] multimedia/media_utils.py
    - [x] MediaUtils (comprehensive utility class)

- [x] multimedia/ffmpeg_wrapper.py
    - [x] FFmpegWrapper (async FFmpeg wrapper)

- [x] multimedia/ytdlp_wrapper.py
    - [x] YtDlpWrapper (async yt-dlp wrapper with enhanced features)

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 69
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for MediaProcessor class
- [ ] Add tests for MediaUtils class methods
- [ ] Add tests for FFmpegWrapper async functionality
- [ ] Add tests for YtDlpWrapper async functionality
- [ ] Create integration tests for media processing workflows
- [ ] Add tests for error handling in media operations
- [ ] Test media format conversions and processing pipelines

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
