    Media Processor for Multimedia Operations

The MediaProcessor class provides a comprehensive interface for coordinating multimedia
operations across different backend libraries including yt-dlp for video downloading
and FFmpeg for media conversion. It serves as a high-level abstraction that manages
the complexity of multiple multimedia tools while providing a consistent API for
common media processing workflows.

This class automatically detects available backend libraries and gracefully handles
scenarios where certain tools are not installed, providing clear feedback about
available capabilities. It supports asynchronous operations for improved performance
and provides detailed logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Args:
    default_output_dir (Optional[str], optional): Default directory path for output files.
        If not provided, defaults to the current working directory. The directory will
        be created if it doesn't exist. Defaults to None.
    enable_logging (bool, optional): Enable detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
        When True, logs initialization status, operation progress, and error details.
        Defaults to True.

Key Features:
- Unified interface for video downloading and media conversion
- Automatic backend availability detection and graceful degradation
- Asynchronous operation support for improved performance
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Flexible output directory management
- Quality and format selection for downloads and conversions
- Capability introspection for runtime feature detection

Attributes:
    default_output_dir (Path): Default directory for output files, resolved to absolute path
    enable_logging (bool): Flag indicating whether detailed logging is enabled
    ytdlp (Optional[YtDlpWrapper]): yt-dlp wrapper instance for video downloading,
        None if yt-dlp is not available
    ffmpeg (Optional[FFmpegWrapper]): FFmpeg wrapper instance for media conversion,
        None if FFmpeg is not available

Public Methods:
    download_and_convert(url: str, output_format: str = "mp4", quality: str = "best") -> Dict[str, Any]:
        Downloads video from URL and optionally converts to specified format.
        Coordinates between yt-dlp for downloading and FFmpeg for conversion,
        providing comprehensive status reporting and error handling.
    get_capabilities() -> Dict[str, Any]:
        Returns detailed information about available backends and supported operations.
        Useful for runtime capability detection and user interface adaptation.

Usage Example:
    # Basic usage with default settings
    processor = MediaProcessor()
    
    # Download and convert video
    result = await processor.download_and_convert(
        url="https://youtube.com/watch?v=example",
        output_format="mp4",
        quality="720p"
    )
    
    # Check available capabilities
    capabilities = processor.get_capabilities()
    if capabilities["supported_operations"]["download"]:
        print("Video downloading is available")
    
    # Custom output directory and logging
    processor = MediaProcessor(
        default_output_dir="/path/to/output",
        enable_logging=True
    )

Notes:
    - Requires yt-dlp for video downloading functionality
    - Requires FFmpeg for media conversion functionality
    - Operations gracefully degrade when backends are unavailable
    - All file paths are resolved to absolute paths for consistency
    - Error handling provides both machine-readable status codes and human-readable messages

## __init__

```python
def __init__(self, default_output_dir: Optional[str] = None, enable_logging: bool = True) -> None:
    """
    Initialize the MediaProcessor with specified configuration options.

Sets up the media processor by configuring output directories, initializing
logging, and creating wrapper instances for available backend libraries.
The initialization process detects which multimedia tools are available
and configures the processor accordingly.

Args:
    default_output_dir (Optional[str], optional): Default directory path for output files.
        Can be relative or absolute path. If relative, it will be resolved relative
        to the current working directory. If None, uses current working directory.
        The directory will be created if it doesn't exist. Defaults to None.
    enable_logging (bool, optional): Enable detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
        When True, logs initialization status, backend availability, operation progress,
        and error details to the configured logger. Defaults to True.

Attributes initialized:
    default_output_dir (Path): Resolved absolute path for default output directory.
        Created from provided path or current working directory if None.
    enable_logging (bool): Flag indicating whether detailed logging is enabled.
    ytdlp (Optional[YtDlpWrapper]): yt-dlp wrapper instance for video downloading.
        Initialized only if yt-dlp is available, otherwise None.
    ffmpeg (Optional[FFmpegWrapper]): FFmpeg wrapper instance for media conversion.
        Initialized only if FFmpeg is available, otherwise None.

Raises:
    OSError: If the default_output_dir cannot be created due to permission issues
        or invalid path specifications.
    ImportError: If required dependencies for wrapper initialization are missing
        beyond the expected optional dependencies.

Examples:
    >>> # Basic initialization with defaults
    >>> processor = MediaProcessor()
    
    >>> # Custom output directory
    >>> processor = MediaProcessor(default_output_dir="/tmp/media_output")
    
    >>> # Disable logging for production use
    >>> processor = MediaProcessor(enable_logging=False)
    
    >>> # Full configuration
    >>> processor = MediaProcessor(
    ...     default_output_dir="./downloads",
    ...     enable_logging=True
    ... )

Note:
    The initialization process logs the availability status of backend libraries
    (yt-dlp and FFmpeg) when logging is enabled.

## download_and_convert

```python
async def download_and_convert(self, url: str, output_format: str = "mp4", quality: str = "best") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Download video from URL and optionally convert to specified format.

This method provides a complete workflow for acquiring and processing video content
by coordinating between yt-dlp for downloading and FFmpeg for format conversion.
It handles the complexity of chaining operations while providing comprehensive
error handling and status reporting throughout the process.

The method first attempts to download the video using yt-dlp in the specified
quality, then evaluates whether format conversion is needed based on the downloaded
file format and requested output format. If conversion is required and FFmpeg is
available, it performs the conversion and reports both download and conversion results.

Args:
    url (str): Video URL to download. Must be a valid URL supported by yt-dlp,
        including YouTube, Vimeo, and hundreds of other video platforms.
        Examples: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123", "https://vimeo.com/123456789"
    output_format (str, optional): Desired output format for the final video file.
        Common formats include "mp4", "avi", "mkv", "webm", "mov". The format
        determines the container and potentially triggers conversion if the
        downloaded format differs. Defaults to "mp4".
    quality (str, optional): Quality preference for video download. Options include
        "best", "worst", specific resolutions like "720p", "1080p", or format
        specifiers like "mp4[height<=720]". Defaults to "best".

Returns:
    Dict[str, Any]: Comprehensive result dictionary containing operation status
        and detailed information. Structure varies based on operation outcome:
        
        Success case:
        {
            "status": "success",
            "output_path": str,  # Path to downloaded file
            "title": str,        # Video title
            "duration": float,   # Duration in seconds
            "filesize": int,     # File size in bytes
            "format": str,       # Downloaded format
            "converted_path": str,      # Path to converted file (if conversion occurred)
            "conversion_result": Dict   # Conversion operation details (if applicable)
        }
        
        Error cases:
        {
            "status": "error",
            "error": str  # Human-readable error description
        }

Raises:
    ValueError: If url is empty, invalid, or not supported by available backends.
    TypeError: If url is not a string or if quality/output_format parameters
        are not strings.
    OSError: If output directory is not writable or disk space is insufficient.
    asyncio.TimeoutError: If download or conversion operations exceed timeout limits.
    Exception: For unexpected errors during download or conversion operations,
        with error details logged and included in return dictionary.

Examples:
    >>> # Basic video download
    >>> result = await processor.download_and_convert("https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123")
    >>> print(f"Downloaded: {result['output_path']}")
    
    >>> # Download with specific quality and format
    >>> result = await processor.download_and_convert(
    ...     url="https://vimeo.com/123456789",
    ...     output_format="avi",
    ...     quality="720p"
    ... )
    
    >>> # Error handling
    >>> result = await processor.download_and_convert("invalid_url")
    >>> if result["status"] == "error":
    ...     print(f"Download failed: {result['error']}")

Note:
    - Requires yt-dlp to be available for download functionality
    - Format conversion only occurs if FFmpeg is available and formats differ
    - Original downloaded file is preserved even after conversion
    - Progress information is logged when logging is enabled
    - Operation respects rate limiting and platform-specific restrictions

## get_capabilities

```python
def get_capabilities(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get comprehensive information about available capabilities and supported operations.

This method provides runtime introspection of the MediaProcessor's capabilities
by checking the availability of backend libraries and determining which operations
are supported. It's useful for adapting user interfaces, validating operation
requests, and providing informative feedback about system capabilities.

The capabilities information includes both individual backend availability and
composite operation support, allowing callers to understand not just what tools
are available but what complete workflows can be executed.

Returns:
    Dict[str, Any]: Comprehensive capabilities information with the following structure:
    {
        "ytdlp_available": bool,      # Whether yt-dlp backend is available
        "ffmpeg_available": bool,     # Whether FFmpeg backend is available
        "supported_operations": {
            "download": bool,                    # Video downloading capability
            "convert": bool,                     # Media conversion capability
            "download_and_convert": bool         # Complete workflow capability
        }
    }

Examples:
    >>> capabilities = processor.get_capabilities()
    >>> 
    >>> # Check if downloading is supported
    >>> if capabilities["supported_operations"]["download"]:
    ...     print("Video downloading is available")
    ... else:
    ...     print("yt-dlp is required for video downloading")
    >>> 
    >>> # Adapt UI based on capabilities
    >>> if capabilities["ytdlp_available"] and capabilities["ffmpeg_available"]:
    ...     show_full_interface()
    ... elif capabilities["ytdlp_available"]:
    ...     show_download_only_interface()
    ... else:
    ...     show_no_capabilities_message()
    >>> 
    >>> # Validate operation before attempting
    >>> if not capabilities["supported_operations"]["convert"]:
    ...     raise RuntimeError("Conversion not supported - FFmpeg required")

Note:
    - Capability detection is performed at initialization time
    - Results reflect the state at processor creation, not current runtime state
    - Backend availability depends on proper installation and system PATH configuration
    - Composite operations require all constituent backends to be available
    - This method is synchronous and performs no external operations
