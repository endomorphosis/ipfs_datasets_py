# TODO List for optimizers/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 65**: Complete TDD tasks for optimizers/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: OPTIMIZERS DIRECTORY SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that are already implemented
**Resolution**: The optimizers directory contains comprehensive optimizer metrics and alert system implementations

## Current State Summary
- optimizer_learning_metrics.py contains LearningMetrics and OptimizerLearningMetricsCollector classes
- optimizer_alert_system.py contains LearningAnomaly (dataclass) and LearningAlertSystem classes
- optimizer_learning_metrics_integration.py contains MetricsCollectorAdapter class
- optimizer_visualization_integration.py contains LiveOptimizerVisualization class
- Directory has working optimizer monitoring, metrics collection, and alert systems
- Worker 65 should focus on testing existing implementation rather than TDD of new code

## Tasks - Optimizer Classes (IMPLEMENTED)

- [x] optimizers/optimizer_learning_metrics.py
    - [x] LearningMetrics
    - [x] OptimizerLearningMetricsCollector (comprehensive implementation)

- [x] optimizers/optimizer_alert_system.py
    - [x] LearningAnomaly (dataclass)
    - [x] LearningAlertSystem (comprehensive implementation)

- [x] optimizers/optimizer_learning_metrics_integration.py
    - [x] MetricsCollectorAdapter

- [x] optimizers/optimizer_visualization_integration.py
    - [x] LiveOptimizerVisualization

## Remaining Tasks for Worker 65
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for OptimizerLearningMetricsCollector class
- [ ] Add tests for LearningAlertSystem class
- [ ] Add tests for LearningAnomaly dataclass
- [ ] Add tests for MetricsCollectorAdapter class
- [ ] Add tests for LiveOptimizerVisualization class
- [ ] Create integration tests for optimizer monitoring workflows
- [ ] Add tests for metrics collection and alert generation
- [ ] Test visualization integration functionality

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)
