## Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update Documentation

#### After Every Code Change
- [ ] Update relevant module README if behavior changed
- [ ] Update code examples if API changed
- [ ] Add entry to CHANGELOG_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS.md

#### After Feature Addition
- [ ] Update MASTER_STATUS.md (feature completeness matrix)
- [ ] Remove from DEFERRED_FEATURES.md (or mark complete)
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md (mark milestone complete)
- [ ] Add usage example to KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md
- [ ] Update relevant API documentation
- [ ] Update README.md quick examples if applicable

#### After Feature Deferral
- [ ] Add to DEFERRED_FEATURES.md with timeline, workaround, effort
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md (add to appropriate version)
- [ ] Document workaround in relevant module README

#### After Test Addition
- [ ] Update tests/knowledge_graphs/TEST_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Update MASTER_STATUS.md (coverage numbers)

#### Quarterly or After Major Release
- [ ] Review MASTER_STATUS.md for accuracy
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md with new priorities
- [ ] Review DEFERRED_FEATURES.md for completed items
- [ ] Archive superseded planning documents

### Documentation Quality Checklist

---

## Documentation Patterns

### Status Indicators

Use these consistently across all documentation:

- ✅ **Complete** - Implemented, tested, production-ready
- ⚠️ **Planned** - Implementation scheduled, design complete
- 📋 **Future** - Planned for future version, design pending
- 🔴 **Not Implemented** - Raises NotImplementedError, workaround documented
- 🏗️ **In Progress** - Currently being implemented
- 🗄️ **Archived** - Historical reference only

### Version References

Always reference versions with format:

```markdown
**Since:** v1.0.0
**Deprecated in:** v2.0.0
**Removed in:** v3.0.0
**Planned for:** v2.1.0 (June 2026)
```

### Code Examples

Always include:
- Working, tested code
- Import statements
- Comments explaining key points
- Expected output

```python
from ipfs_datasets_py.knowledge_graphs.extraction import KnowledgeGraphExtractor

# Create extractor
extractor = KnowledgeGraphExtractor()

# Extract knowledge graph
text = "Marie Curie was a physicist."
kg = extractor.extract_knowledge_graph(text)

# Expected output: KnowledgeGraph with 1 entity, 0 relationships
print(f"Entities: {len(kg.entities)}")  # Output: Entities: 1
```

### Cross-References

Use relative links:

```markdown
See [MASTER_STATUS.md](./MASTER_STATUS.md) for complete status.

For API details, see [docs/knowledge_graphs/EXTRACTION_API.md](../../docs/knowledge_graphs/EXTRACTION_API.md).

Module documentation: [extraction/README.md](./extraction/README.md)
```

## Common Documentation Tasks

### Task: Add a New Feature

1. **Implement the feature** (with tests)

2. **Update core documentation:**
   ```bash
   # Update status
   - MASTER_STATUS.md (feature completeness matrix)
   - CHANGELOG_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS.md (add entry)
   
   # Remove from deferred
   - DEFERRED_FEATURES.md (mark as complete or remove)
   - ROADMAP.md (mark milestone complete)
   ```

3. **Update user documentation:**
   ```bash
   # Add examples
   - KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md
   - README.md (if major feature)
   - QUICKSTART.md (if core feature)
   
   # Update API docs
   - docs/knowledge_graphs/EXTRACTION_API.md (if extraction)
   - docs/knowledge_graphs/QUERY_API.md (if query)
   ```

4. **Update module documentation:**
   ```bash
   # Update relevant module README
   - extraction/README.md
   - cypher/README.md
   - etc.
   ```

### Task: Defer a Feature

1. **Add to DEFERRED_FEATURES.md:**
   ```markdown
   ### Feature Name
   
   **Status:** 🔴 Not Implemented
   **Location:** filename.py:line
   **Current State:** NotImplementedError or pass statement
   **Reason for Deferral:** Clear explanation
   
   **Impact:**
   - Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
   - Workaround: Clear alternative
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   # What you want
   # What to do instead (workaround)
   ```
   
   **Timeline:** vX.X.X (Month Year)
   **Effort:** X-Y hours
   ```

2. **Update ROADMAP.md:**
   Add to appropriate version section with effort estimate

3. **Update MASTER_STATUS.md:**
   Add to "Remaining Deferred Features" section

### Task: Archive Old Documentation

1. **Determine if document is superseded:**
   - Is there a newer version?
   - Is the information still accurate?
   - Is it referenced by current documents?

2. **Move to archive:**
   ```bash
   # Planning documents
   mv OLD_PLAN.md archive/superseded_plans/
   
   # Historical summaries
   mv OLD_SUMMARY.md archive/refactoring_history/
   ```

3. **Update archive/README.md:**
   ```markdown
   ### Superseded Plans
   - OLD_PLAN.md (Date: YYYY-MM-DD, Superseded by: NEW_PLAN.md)
   ```

4. **Update references:**
   - Find all documents linking to archived doc
   - Update links to point to current version
   - Note archival reason if relevant

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming

- Use underscores for spaces: `COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS_2026_02_18.md`
- Use CAPS for core documentation: `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
- Include dates for time-specific docs: `PLAN_2026_02_18.md`
- Use descriptive names: `P3_P4_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

### File Organization

```
knowledge_graphs/
├── MASTER_STATUS.md (⭐ single source of truth)
├── COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS_2026_02_18.md (analysis)
├── IMPROVEMENT_TODO.md (infinite backlog)
├── README.md (module overview)
├── QUICKSTART.md (getting started)
├── INDEX.md (documentation index)
├── DEFERRED_FEATURES.md (planned features)
├── ROADMAP.md (development plan)
├── CHANGELOG_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS.md (version history)
├── DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md (this file)
├── P3_P4_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md (implementation record)
├── archive/ (historical documents)
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── superseded_plans/
│   └── refactoring_history/
└── [subdirectories with READMEs]/
```

### Heading Structure

Always use hierarchy:

```markdown
# Title (H1) - Document title only
## Section (H2) - Major sections
### Subsection (H3) - Sub-topics
#### Detail (H4) - Fine details
```

Never skip levels (no H1 → H3)

### Tables

Use for structured data:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
```

Always include header row separator

### Lists

**Ordered lists** for sequential steps:
```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

**Unordered lists** for collections:
```markdown
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three
```

**Checklists** for tasks:
```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
```
