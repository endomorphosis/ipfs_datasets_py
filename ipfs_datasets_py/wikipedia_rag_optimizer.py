    Wikipedia Relationship Weight Calculator for Graph Traversal Optimization

    The WikipediaRelationshipWeightCalculator class provides sophisticated functionality for
    calculating and managing weights for different relationship types found in Wikipedia-derived
    knowledge graphs. It assigns importance scores to various relationship types based on their
    semantic value and traversal efficiency, enabling optimized graph exploration strategies.
    This class serves as a core component for prioritizing relationship traversals in Wikipedia
    knowledge graphs, supporting both default weight schemes and custom weight configurations.

    Key Features:
    - Hierarchical relationship type prioritization with semantic weights
    - Category-based relationship weight assignment for Wikipedia structures
    - Topic and causal relationship scoring for knowledge discovery
    - Customizable weight schemes with fallback defaults
    - Relationship type normalization and standardization
    - High-value relationship filtering based on weight thresholds
    - Prioritized relationship sorting for traversal optimization

    Attributes:
        weights (Dict[str, float]): Mapping of relationship types to their assigned weights.
            Combines default weights with any custom overrides provided during initialization.
            Higher weights indicate more important relationships for traversal prioritization.
        DEFAULT_RELATIONSHIP_WEIGHTS (Dict[str, float]): Class-level default weight assignments
            for common Wikipedia relationship types including hierarchical, category, topic,
            authorship, temporal, and causal relationships.

    Public Methods:
        get_relationship_weight(relationship_type: str) -> float:
            Retrieve the weight for a specific relationship type with normalization.
            Returns the assigned weight or default weight for unknown types.
        get_prioritized_relationship_types(relationship_types: List[str]) -> List[str]:
            Sort relationship types by their weights in descending order for traversal
            optimization and priority-based graph exploration.
        get_filtered_high_value_relationships(relationship_types: List[str], min_weight: float = 0.7) -> List[str]:
            Filter relationship types to only include those meeting minimum weight thresholds
            for focused traversal on high-value relationships.

    Private Methods:
        _normalize_relationship_type(relationship_type: str) -> str:
            Normalize relationship type strings for consistent lookup and weight assignment.
            Handles variations in naming conventions and converts to standardized format.

    Usage Example:
        calculator = WikipediaRelationshipWeightCalculator({
            "custom_relation": 1.8,
            "special_link": 0.3

    - Connection-based popularity assessment using inbound and outbound links
    - Reference count analysis for credibility and authority scoring
    - Category importance integration for contextual relevance
    - Explicitness scoring based on mention frequency and prominence
    - Recency scoring for temporal relevance in dynamic knowledge graphs
    - Performance-optimized caching for repeated entity evaluations
    - Logarithmic scaling for handling wide ranges in connectivity metrics

    Attributes:
        entity_importance_cache (Dict[str, float]): Cache mapping entity IDs to their
            calculated importance scores to avoid redundant computations and improve

    Wikipedia Path Optimizer for Graph Traversal Strategy Optimization

    The WikipediaPathOptimizer class provides sophisticated functionality for optimizing

    - Cost-benefit analysis for different traversal strategies
    - Performance-optimized path selection using weighted relationship types
    - Dynamic budget allocation with exponential decay for depth levels

    """
    Specialized Wikipedia Graph RAG Query Rewriter for Knowledge Graph Optimization

    The WikipediaGraphRAGQueryRewriter class extends the base QueryRewriter with
    sophisticated rewriting strategies tailored to Wikipedia-derived knowledge graphs.
    It implements domain-specific query pattern detection and optimization techniques
    that leverage the unique characteristics of Wikipedia knowledge structures,
    including hierarchical categories, entity relationships, and semantic patterns.
    This class serves as a core component for query transformation and optimization,
    supporting both pattern-based rewriting and structural query enhancement.

    Key Features:
    - Wikipedia-specific query pattern detection and classification
    - Domain-aware query rewriting for topic lookup, comparison, and definition queries

    - Causal and temporal relationship optimization for Wikipedia content
    - Collection and listing query optimization for structured knowledge discovery
    - Relationship type prioritization using Wikipedia-specific weight calculations
    - Pattern-specific traversal strategy assignment

    Attributes:
