## Current Planning Documents

For **current** refactoring and improvement plans, see:

## Why Archive These?

These documents are archived to:
1. **Reduce clutter** in the main logic/ directory
2. **Preserve history** for future reference
3. **Avoid confusion** about which plans are active
4. **Maintain repository cleanliness**

The information they contain is still valuable for understanding the evolution of the module, but should not be used as current guidance.
