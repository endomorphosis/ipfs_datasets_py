# TODO List for wikipedia_x/

## Worker Assignment
**Worker 73**: Complete TDD tasks for wikipedia_x/ directory

## Documentation Reconciliation Update (Worker 1) - 2025-07-04-17-14
**Status**: WIKIPEDIA_X DIRECTORY MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION
**Issue**: TODO file contained TDD tasks for classes that don't exist yet
**Resolution**: The wikipedia_x directory has minimal implementation - this is likely where actual development is needed

## Current State Summary
- index.py contains minimal imports (just `import datasets`)
- install/ subdirectory exists
- test/ subdirectory exists
- Directory appears to need substantial development
- Worker 73 should focus on actual implementation tasks here

## Tasks - Wikipedia X Development (NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION)

- [ ] wikipedia_x/index.py
    - [ ] Create WikipediaProcessor class for processing Wikipedia datasets
    - [ ] Add Wikipedia data extraction methods
    - [ ] Add Wikipedia data transformation methods
    - [ ] Add integration with IPFS for Wikipedia data storage

## Development Tasks for Worker 73
- [ ] Analyze requirements for wikipedia_x functionality
- [ ] Design and implement WikipediaProcessor class
- [ ] Add Wikipedia dataset processing capabilities
- [ ] Create tests for Wikipedia processing functionality
- [ ] Add documentation for Wikipedia integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing IPFS and embeddings systems

## Test-Driven Development Tasks

This file contains TDD tasks extracted from the master todo list.
Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Write function stub with type hints and comprehensive docstring
2. Write test that calls the actual (not-yet-implemented) callable 
3. Write additional test cases for edge cases and error conditions
4. Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
5. Implement the method to make tests pass (green phase)
6. Refactor implementation while keeping tests passing (refactor phase)

## Tasks

            - [ ] Run all tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
