# CLAUDE.md

## Project Rules
- You will be assigned a designation number and the directory it is assigned to.
- Only work in your designated directory. Every directory and file outside it is to be considered a black box that you cannot modify or access.
- Boxes marked with X are jobs currently taken by other workers. Do not attempt to work on these jobs.

### Rules for All Jobs
- Document all actions taken in your directory's CHANGELOG.md
- Document all actions that need to be do be done in your directory's TODO.md
- Document your software architecture decisions in your directory's ARCHITECTURE.md
- Read the CHANGELOG.md and TODO.md files in your directory before starting work. If you cannot find one, ask for it before looking for it.

### Coordination Guidelines
- **Cross-Directory Dependencies**: Coordinate with other workers through project-level TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md, and CLAUDE.md files.
- **Tool Standards**: All adhoc tools must use argparse and follow template in `adhoc_tools/README.md`. Adhoc tools are defined as tools that are created by workers as they work on their assigned directories, but might be useful to other workers in the future. They are not part of the main codebase, but are used to help workers complete their tasks.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Use `python adhoc_tools/find_documentation.py` to track documentation status
- **Completed Workers**: 67 (search/), 130 (tests/) - Available for coordination and integration tasks

# Advice for All Workers
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
