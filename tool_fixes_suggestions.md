# MCP Tools Fix Suggestions\n\n## dataset_tools/load_dataset\n\n
Fix: The test is failing because the mock dataset source doesn't exist. 
Use a better mock or test with valid parameters:
- Mock the HuggingFace datasets.load_dataset function properly
- Provide realistic test data that won't cause errors
\n\n## dataset_tools/save_dataset\n\n
Fix: The DatasetManager class doesn't exist in dataset_serialization module.
Need to either:
- Check what the actual class name is in dataset_serialization.py
- Mock the correct class name
- Or mock the entire module if the implementation is different
\n\n## dataset_tools/convert_dataset_format\n\n
Fix: Function signature mismatch. The convert_dataset_format function
doesn't accept 'input_format' parameter.
- Check the actual function signature in the implementation
- Update test to match the actual parameters
\n\n## audit_tools/record_audit_event\n\n
Fix: The AuditLogger class doesn't have a 'log_event' method.
- Check the actual method name in the AuditLogger class
- Update the test to call the correct method
\n\n## audit_tools/generate_audit_report\n\n
Fix: The generate_audit_report function doesn't support 'summary' report type.
- Check what report types are actually supported
- Use a valid report type in the test
\n\n## cli/execute_command\n\n
Fix: The execute_command is working but doesn't actually execute commands for security.
- Update test expectations to match the security behavior
- Test for the 'message' field instead of 'output'
\n\n## web_archive_tools/*\n\n
Fix: These tools are returning dict instead of awaitable.
- Check if these functions are actually async
- If they're sync functions, don't use 'await'
- Update the test framework to handle both sync and async properly
